as a presidential candidate in N george bush <unk> expressed his position on abortion in an interview with <unk> stone magazine published that march
what did he think of the supreme court 's decision <unk> abortion
i happen to think it was right mr. bush said <unk>
a few months later mr. bush became ronald reagan 's running <unk>
suddenly george bush the pro-choice <unk> became george bush the <unk>
and the <unk> did n't end there
just a month ago mr. bush <unk> threatened to veto a pending <unk> bill if it provided any abortion funds except to save a woman 's life
then two weeks ago <unk> that i 'm not looking for any conflict over this the president said he would consider a compromise to fund abortions for poor women in cases of rape and incest
but only four days after that mr. bush <unk> the veto threat
i do not support federal funding for abortions except where the mother 's life is threatened he <unk> and finally <unk> the measure last weekend
so what does george bush really believe
the answer is so <unk> that it is beginning to get this popular president in trouble with each of the increasingly <unk> increasingly powerful sides of the abortion issue
the result is <unk> and criticism from all around
anti-abortion forces <unk> him as at best an uncertain <unk>
in all <unk> if you ask me is this man a true <unk> i do n't know says john <unk> head of the <unk> ad <unk> committee in defense of life inc
yet abortion-rights forces remain <unk> critical
douglas gould vice president of communications for the planned <unk> <unk> of america calls mr. bush 's position on the <unk> issue extremely <unk> adding the guy has n't done one thing about <unk>
he 's totally <unk> to a <unk> position
mr. bush is <unk> <unk> with the entire abortion question
for most of the past nine years he has <unk> to <unk> anti-abortion activists of his <unk> support for their position
but ever since the supreme court 's webster vs. <unk> health services decision this year changed the political <unk> of the abortion issue the president <unk> has tried just as hard to avoid saying anything more unless <unk> to the wall
many americans still <unk> over their own personal <unk> about abortion
mr. bush 's problem is n't so much that he seems to be <unk> over the issue as it is that he seems to <unk> on it
the political risk would be far less if the president drew a firm line and <unk> to it experts insist
if you have a position you 're better off to stick with it than to move around very much says republican strategist john sears
the need for <unk> is especially <unk> for mr. bush who mr. sears <unk> <unk> a strong <unk> base
by his moderate republican <unk> as well as the <unk> of political advisers who say the issue is <unk> to younger voters the president might seem to have at least some <unk> with abortion-rights <unk>
yet he is also <unk> <unk> by his <unk> <unk> and promises he made to anti-abortion activists during his long pursuit of the white house
on many issues <unk> for instance his <unk> political <unk> <unk> such <unk>
but mr. bush and his advisers <unk> the politics of the abortion issue failing to <unk> how <unk> the abortion-rights movement would be <unk> following last summer 's supreme court decision to restrict those rights in the webster case
it was one of the <unk> changes in public <unk> i 've ever seen says former reagan <unk> richard <unk>
these days when others raise the subject of abortion the usually <unk> president can be <unk> almost to the point of <unk>
<unk> days ago he was asked to <unk> the reasons behind his anti-abortion stance
my position is well-known and <unk> he <unk>
a close look at his record over the last N years suggests that mr. bush has <unk> his views on all sides of the issue
in N as the u.s. representative to the united nations he wrote an <unk> to a book on world population in which he <unk> of his leadership during his term in congress in expanding <unk> services for the poor
running for president in early N he was also quoted as supporting federal funding for abortions in cases of rape incest and to save the life of the mother
in his <unk> stone interview in N mr. bush <unk> his abortion-rights <unk> to contrast himself with his rival ronald reagan
in addition to supporting the <unk> <unk> vs. <unk> supreme court decision <unk> abortion mr. bush said he opposed the constitutional ban on abortion that mr. reagan was promising to promote
as mr. reagan 's running <unk> though mr. bush plunged <unk> into the anti-abortion position <unk> a constitutional amendment <unk> abortion
he acknowledged only one difference with mr. reagan that the amendment ought to have <unk> for rape and incest as well as to save a woman 's life
throughout the early 1980s mr. bush was quoted sometimes supporting federal funding for abortion in cases of rape and incest and sometimes <unk> it
in april N <unk> president bush had his staff write a letter <unk> out that he would support a constitutional amendment <unk> abortions except in cases of rape incest and life <unk> but that he opposed federal funding in all but the <unk> case
at the gop <unk> last year he again came out for an amendment with <unk> for rape incest and life <unk>
his <unk> <unk> momentum as he <unk> into office <unk> his firm support of our cause during an anti-abortion rally three days after his <unk> last january
he again urged <unk> of a constitutional amendment <unk> abortion
but when the high court ruled in the webster case in july the president began to lower the volume
when the ruling was <unk> down the <unk> president <unk> chief of staff john <unk> to issue a statement and refused to answer questions himself
he did later <unk> <unk> over legislation <unk> the district of columbia 's right to use its own tax money to fund abortions for poor women and over <unk> funding to the united nations population fund
but in the months since then while trying to <unk> up support for other issues such as an <unk> constitutional amendment he has <unk> away from talking about abortion
what few comments he has <unk> have been <unk> such as urging greater efforts toward the protection of human life at a meeting of <unk> lawyers in boston last month
the white house has <unk> avoided any involvement in florida 's recent special legislative session on abortion which anti-abortion forces had regarded as a key test of their ability to get state lawmakers to <unk> abortion restrictions
the session failed to <unk> any new <unk>
now some see mr. bush <unk> in a position he is neither comfortable with nor able to escape

this is how american women won the right to vote

for the more than N million americans with <unk> the N americans with <unk> act provides the missing piece

goodyear tire & <unk> co. <unk> by improved operating profit in its tire segment reported that third-quarter net income rose N N to $ N million or $ N a share
in the year-ago period goodyear had net of $ N million or $ N a share
sales rose slightly to $ N billion from $ N billion
analysts had mixed <unk> to the results
donald <unk> an independent analyst in new <unk> conn. said he was <unk> with the company 's performance
he said results were better than he 'd expected and indicate that goodyear is in the <unk> of a turnaround from a string of lackluster quarters that have <unk> the company for a year
however harry <unk> an analyst at mcdonald & co. cleveland said goodyear 's results fell at the bottom of his range of estimates
excluding an increase in the tax rate and the effects of foreign currency <unk> mr. <unk> said the company 's results were still a little disappointing
goodyear 's stock which has been weak in recent weeks fell $ N yesterday to close at $ N a share in composite trading on the new york stock exchange
the <unk> <unk> company said pretax operating income in its tire segment jumped about N N to $ N million from $ N million a year earlier reflecting improvements in raw material costs sales of replacement <unk> and pricing
mcdonald 's mr. <unk> said goodyear appeared to have held or gained some market share in the u.s. for the first time since the second quarter of N
but goodyear said total u.s. tire unit sales were off about N N
total tire segment sales were up only about N N to $ N billion and the company said it reduced manufacturing levels at some of its u.s. tire plants because of <unk> <unk> and <unk> production by auto makers
in the latest quarter goodyear 's tax rate was N N compared with N N a year earlier
as a result total tax <unk> were $ N million compared with $ N million the year earlier
for the nine months profit <unk> about N N reflecting charges taken in this year 's second quarter and the effect of <unk> of weaker foreign currencies into the stronger u.s. dollar
net was $ N million or $ N a share compared with net of $ N million or $ N a share the year earlier
the latest nine months included charges of $ N million related to the company 's south african subsidiary and <unk> <unk> sold by its crude oil pipeline unit
sales rose nearly N N to $ N billion from $ N billion
environmental control group inc. said it expects to report minimal earnings or a loss for the third quarter
the environmental services company said that the <unk> of unsuccessful product lines and an increase in <unk> reserves probably will result in charges of $ N million to $ N million most of which will be taken against third-quarter results
in the year-ago quarter the company reported earnings of $ N million or N cents a share
former usx corp. chairman david m. roderick may have been lucky he retired last may
as he <unk> over the <unk> to successor charles a. corry steel profits were close to a cyclical peak
though imports were <unk> they were n't running away with the market and american companies had high hopes that steel import <unk> would be extended for another five years
perhaps most important <unk> icahn who had once threatened a hostile takeover bid was <unk>
he and mr. roderick were even <unk> out together
today mr. corry <unk> over a company whose <unk> have changed <unk>
mr. icahn the company 's <unk> <unk> <unk> recently disclosed that he had raised his usx stake to N N and he again threatened a takeover
a battle with mr. icahn would <unk> even the most <unk> chief executive to say nothing of one who took the <unk> less than five months ago
in addition usx 's giant steel segment representing N N of its N sales is facing <unk> demand and slipping prices as well as increasing competition from foreign <unk> and <unk> <unk>
the import <unk> got only a N <unk> <unk> and usx is <unk> under a <unk> $ N billion debt at a time when it must spend money to <unk> steel mills and <unk> for oil
it 's a <unk> of fire for corry says one usx executive
the <unk> question is whether the new chief can <unk> mr. icahn without being pushed into <unk> moves
mr. corry might have to <unk> the company more than he wants to
or he might have to <unk> a huge expense of either buying mr. icahn 's stock possibly at a premium or paying stockholders a special dividend partly because of mr. icahn 's pressure
with his recent purchases of usx common stock mr. icahn <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> agreement with mr. roderick
in N mr. roderick <unk> <unk> mr. icahn 's first <unk> after the takeover specialist had built up an N N stake
mr. roderick did so by having usx <unk> a series of guaranteed notes a move that in effect raised the cost of a $ N billion icahn bid by about $ N billion
and he managed to fend off further advances and even strike up an unlikely <unk> with the <unk>
over <unk> at new york 's <unk> club and <unk> club restaurants the steel executive and the big investor talked steel international trade and <unk> <unk>
mr. corry who has <unk> up on corporate <unk> by reading t. <unk> <unk> 's <unk> had hoped the <unk> would continue
he was <unk> associates say to learn of mr. icahn 's new takeover threat
both men declined to be interviewed for this article
but the <unk> competitive mr. corry quickly showed he 's no <unk>
he <unk> with directors at a special meeting two weeks ago and tried to block his <unk>
although the board believed that mr. icahn is more interested in talking the stock price higher than acquiring usx it adopted a <unk> defense to be <unk> if anyone <unk> a N N stake
now it 's mr. icahn 's move
will he try to gain a seat on or control of the board and force a radical split of usx into separate oil and steel companies
given the weakness of the junk-bond market can he finance a buy-out
mr. icahn may not want to sell out unless he can get a special dividend similar to one he received before selling his stake in texaco inc. in june a coup that gave him enough cash to make his usx move
and although the recent turmoil in the stock and junk-bond markets by making it harder to <unk> takeover financing has eased some of the pressure on mr. corry it does n't end the takeover threat
i know it 's not over a <unk> mr. corry acknowledged while <unk> steel suppliers in new york on oct. N and <unk> them to a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> in <unk> of <unk> steel ltd. usx 's partner in a steel mill in <unk> ohio
in fact it 's barely begun for mr. corry who faces tough decisions before he has had a chance to get settled into his new job
he 's in a vulnerable position because he has n't established much credibility on his own says <unk> <unk> a securities analyst at painewebber inc
the <unk> tax attorney never even <unk> to the job of chief executive
an <unk> college student who <unk> in <unk> until he concluded that he could n't stand cutting up <unk> mr. corry wanted to work for a big company that could do big things
but after joining the tax department of a usx subsidiary N years ago he set the modest goal of becoming tax manager by the age of N
for years he <unk> stuck to the back accounting rooms wearing a <unk> to work because everyone else did
i was never a <unk> he said in an earlier interview
i do n't think most of the people that have been around me would ever say they 've seen me pound the table or get angry
yet the <unk> mr. corry helped <unk> usx 's transition from big steel to big oil
he served as mr. roderick 's front man in <unk> negotiations for the N purchase of <unk> oil for $ N billion
nevertheless mr. corry once named chief executive did n't waste any time <unk> himself from his former boss who still has an office on the <unk> floor of the usx tower in pittsburgh
soon after taking over last june mr. corry <unk> a pay cut imposed on <unk> workers a move that mr. roderick had n't made in <unk> of improved earnings
mr. corry also ruled that all board meetings would be held in pittsburgh instead of new york or <unk> ohio <unk> 's home
and earlier this month he announced the sale of the reserves of texas oil & gas which was acquired three years ago and has n't posted any significant operating profits since
one former executive says nobody wanted that deal inside usx except <unk> roderick who was a <unk> and fishing <unk> of william l. <unk> chairman of texas oil & gas
the executive recalls mr. corry <unk> to him and others remember this was <unk> 's deal
what <unk> many usx executives and shareholders was that the acquisition for $ N billion of stock doubled the usx shares outstanding and <unk> diluted them
what 's more the takeover occurred as <unk> prices were falling and just as texas oil & gas reported its first annual loss in N years
mr. corry expected the texas oil & gas sale to <unk> mr. icahn by <unk> his concern about boosting shareholder value
but when the two men met in new york a day after mr. icahn disclosed the rise in his usx stake mr. corry learned that mr. icahn wanted him to sell all of texas oil not just its reserves of about N trillion <unk> feet of natural gas and N million barrels of oil but also its pipeline <unk> and <unk> operations
that would leave usx with <unk> its steel mills and its <unk> business segment which includes among other things <unk> and transportation products
some <unk> that mr. corry would agree if he could find a buyer at the right price
the problem is that mr. icahn is pushing him to move faster and further in restructuring usx than mr. corry had planned
mr. icahn has long believed associates say that the company whose N sales totaled $ N billion is worth $ N a share if broken up
the stock closed yesterday at $ N giving mr. icahn 's N million shares a value of $ N billion
mr. icahn <unk> the sale of the company 's steel operations and mr. corry does n't necessarily <unk>
unlike his <unk> who saw steel as america 's <unk> mr. corry <unk> to view it as a <unk> and <unk> business with limited potential associates say
in the past five years usx has turned steel into a profit maker by closing several plants and reducing labor costs
but the short-term outlook is <unk>
it is n't surprising that messrs. roderick and corry view steel so <unk>
while mr. roderick was <unk> in the <unk> of pittsburgh 's smoking mills mr. corry grew up in cincinnati a city <unk> <unk> and more <unk> to <unk> <unk> than <unk> <unk>
he has never met <unk> <unk> the president of the united <unk> union and is n't active in the industry 's main trade group the american <unk> and steel institute which mr. roderick served as chairman
<unk> thought the country needed a strong u.s. steel and while <unk> agreed he was more <unk> to say not at any cost to shareholders a former executive says
indeed mr. corry at an august press conference talked about investing in steel as long as it provides a good return and not a day longer
however <unk> steel would run directly counter to mr. roderick 's original <unk> for <unk> into oil and gas having two major products would <unk> the company 's <unk> to one market 's down cycle and help <unk> out the flow of cash and earnings
as mr. roderick once said we 're a <unk> company and <unk> if you ca n't figure out the value of those two parts you are so <unk> <unk> that you do n't <unk> on wall street
moreover the opportunity to sell steel at a price <unk> to usx may be gone for now
the time has passed for us to spin off steel either in a public offering or to a buyer one executive contends
about the only way that usx now can get out of steel is to <unk> it out piece by piece in separate joint ventures he adds
with mr. icahn <unk> down his <unk> however mr. corry may have little choice but to sell at a weak price even if it means losing some <unk> <unk> <unk>
that would leave usx essentially an oil company with <unk> as its core
<unk> has benefited from higher <unk> prices and strong demand for <unk> products
oil has long been mr. corry 's <unk>
indeed when the bush administration finally decided this summer to <unk> import restrictions <unk> the most important decision to affect the steel industry in five years mr. corry and his directors were <unk> <unk> high above <unk> 's rich oil reserves in the north sea
should usx be left with only <unk> mr. corry might well feel pushed to <unk> out other energy companies
however even usx executives who work closely with him are n't sure about his long-term goals
i do n't think he has a clear sense of where he wants the company to go one says
right now the executive adds he wants to continue to focus on paying down usx 's debt by selling assets
one thing is certain however mr. corry while studying other options probably wo n't make a major move until he 's clear about mr. icahn 's <unk>
and then he wo n't panic says j. <unk> <unk> a former usx executive and now a labor and benefit consultant with <unk> cohen & <unk> in pittsburgh
mr. corry learned presence under fire when as vice president of corporate planning he handled what mr. <unk> calls <unk> negotiations that led to usx 's <unk> of a wide <unk> of assets ranging from chemicals to construction
when negotiating mr. corry played his cards close to the <unk>
<unk> johnson who worked for mr. corry in strategic planning recalls how his boss would <unk> ask a <unk> to research an entire industry to target acquisition candidates
what he really wanted to know was about a particular company but you did n't know that
he wanted your own <unk> <unk> opinion says mr. johnson now managing director at <unk> & co. a <unk> and <unk> firm
ever the <unk> mr. corry said in august that he realized that usx is on acquisition screens all over the country
it 's part of the <unk> market system that equity can be bought and equity is bought he said
usx he noted was formed N years ago by in effect buying out a <unk> of other companies
people got rich through takeovers in those days as they do today

sears has been <unk> on growth coming from the large displays of <unk> merchandise it is adding to its stores over the next two years in what it calls power <unk>
but analysts say sears faces an especially <unk> challenge on the <unk> of the christmas shopping season
i believe <unk> pricing in the current environment does n't work says walter <unk> of morgan stanley & co. <unk> to soft <unk> sales
sears is likely to be unsuccessful if it continues with its pricing policy when everyone else is offering unusual values
in what amounts to an <unk> that the transition has n't gone as <unk> as sears had hoped the giant retailer is now trying new ways to <unk> up business without <unk> to <unk> its <unk> strategy
the company is <unk> more special deals in its advertising and stores and it 's offering to <unk> finance charges on certain <unk> items
sears is also <unk> up its television ads and changing its message
in a new tv ad for instance a woman going through the sunday newspaper brands as <unk> claims by other stores that they are offering goods for N N N N and N N off
by <unk> prices throughout its stores she says sears has the right idea
but the ad also <unk> sears 's sales a topic that the retailer has avoided since <unk> to <unk> pricing
when sears has a sale at a special price the woman in the ad <unk> it 's something you do n't want to miss
recent <unk> by <unk> j. <unk> & associates a market research firm in chicago suggest that sears is having a tough time <unk> <unk> because it has n't yet done enough to improve service or its <unk> of merchandise
the number of people who said they were more likely to shop at sears fell in september to N N from N N in march when sears <unk> the <unk> with ads about its new pricing strategy
moreover the number of people who <unk> cited lower prices as the reason for their interest in sears declined to N N in september from N N in march
just N N of the respondents mentioned brands in september up slightly from N N in march
only N N of the people in september cited sears 's friendly personnel
the power of price as an appeal which was very considerable in driving traffic in march and april has <unk> says george <unk> president of <unk> & associates
you see some improvement in these other areas but it 's a very small and slow process

oil imports to japan rose N N in september from year-earlier levels according to statistics released by the government 's ministry of international trade and industry
the imports totaling N million barrels were N N lower than august levels

imports of crude from the middle east grew N N from year-earlier levels and <unk> asian crude imports grew N N
while <unk> crude imports were higher compared with year-earlier levels they fell N N compared with august imports

at this stage some people just walk away from homes where the mortgage <unk> current market value

the problem is so vast that we need to try <unk> solutions in <unk> experiments
here are some ideas
N <unk> homes could be sold by the <unk> for no down payment the biggest <unk> to young buyers but with personal liability for the mortgage no <unk> away by choice
N encourage long-term <unk> by <unk> one month 's payment off the <unk> end of the mortgage for every six months paid or perhaps have the down payment <unk> to the end of the mortgage <unk> but <unk> on a monthly <unk> basis as long as the owner remains the <unk>
N develop <unk> agreements with exclusive purchase options for the <unk>
an <unk> will in most every case be better for the home and neighborhood than a <unk> house
in this way the house is not dumped on to a <unk> market

worse the properties then sit around <unk> for maybe a year or so but are <unk> eventually because of the <unk> of the low down payment <unk> to a <unk> buyer who ca n't afford both the mortgage and needed repairs and having little <unk> interest that buyer will walk away and the <unk> cycle <unk> itself all over again

most analysts had expected a <unk> decline after the steep rise in august
moreover a recent government report showing widespread <unk> in manufacturing had contributed to <unk> that the manufacturing sector of the economy had slowed to a <unk>

but analysts noted that excluding transportation where what they believe was a temporary surge in auto demand pushed up the figures order <unk> have declined for three months in a row
it means we 're <unk> into the <unk> that <unk> us going

it also means if you have a real <unk> in orders production will likely fall off very quickly because there is less to keep things going
capital goods orders outside of the defense sector tumbled for the second month in a row posting a N N drop after a N N decline
such steep <unk> in a category seen as a <unk> of business investment would <unk> be <unk> news for the economy

japan has climbed up from the <unk> of world war ii and a gross national product of about $ N per <unk> to reach the <unk> class among <unk> nations
now this <unk> economic growth seems to be coming to an end because the government has not <unk> itself into a modern democratic developed nation <unk> of operation
until N when japan joined the $ N per <unk> gnp club of the advanced countries it was a model developing nation
the government built <unk> bridges highways schools hospitals and <unk>
when industries were weak it protected them
it gave the japanese people a value system based on the <unk> that given the country 's lack of natural resources they must work hard to create value through exports and buy food with the surplus
individual <unk> <unk> would result
that system has worked
the standard of living has increased steadily over the past N years more than N N of the people consider themselves middle class

the ldp won by a <unk> in the last election in july N

the <unk> all point to one thing japan does not have a modern government
its government still wants to sit in the <unk> 's seat set the speed step on the gas apply the <unk> and <unk> with N million people in the back seat
in a modern system the government 's role is to give the people as much choice as possible and to keep them well informed so they are <unk> of making a choice
it also allows people to buy the best and the <unk> goods from <unk> in the world
the japanese government does n't allow this
the ministry of agriculture and <unk> actually is a ministry for farmers and <unk> instead of a ministry of provisions
the ministry of health and <unk> is a ministry of doctors and pharmaceutical companies rather than an organization <unk> to <unk> the health of the people
the ministry of education is nothing but a <unk> for <unk> teachers and certainly does not act on behalf of students
the ministry of construction <unk> concrete throughout the country and <unk> in international <unk> that japan 's <unk> <unk> per <unk> is the <unk> in the world but they <unk> think of the poor commuters who spend so much time sitting in traffic
the ministry of transportation <unk> the industry certainly not the passengers who must pay <unk> high prices
and the ministry of foreign affairs works for itself supporting japanese <unk> who <unk> <unk> aid money around the world to ensure that their seat at the <unk> table is next to the host 's
this ministry has done nothing to correct the <unk> and <unk> that are at the <unk> of japan 's <unk> image
instead it seems to be using foreign pressure and even the trade conflict to expand its <unk> of influence <unk> a <unk> other <unk>
all this <unk> that japanese <unk> still have a <unk> <unk> they do not serve the people and particularly not consumers
they serve the industries and the <unk> groups
the rest of the world accepted such methods when japan was developing
japanese put up with it because the government provided job <unk> and growing <unk>
japan is not a political country
it is a <unk> country
the diet plays a minor role compared with the powerful <unk> system
most bills are <unk> by bureaucrats not politicians
the diet does n't normally even debate bills because the opposition parties are so often opposed to whatever ldp does that it would be a waste of time
so most bills are passed without full <unk> particularly difficult bills are passed in the absence of the opposition parties
a recent example is the N N consumption tax on all commercial activities
this makes enormous sense in japan where direct tax accounts for more than N N of revenues and the <unk> rate of direct tax is so unfair
if you are a <unk> man <unk> N N <unk>
if you are a retailer N N and a farmer N N
to correct this <unk> most people would have <unk> an <unk> tax like the consumption tax
but the bill was passed without debate in the diet in the absence of the opposition
as a result the japanese people did n't know what to expect when the new law was introduced on april N

taken by surprise the socialist party is busy changing its <unk>
it 's now <unk> to deal with the u.s. but not the soviet union

the <unk> security treaty can continue sort of
and so on
against the rapid <unk> overhaul of the socialist party the ldp has been <unk>
now is the time to reform the government from a <unk> <unk> <unk> role to that of a modern <unk> nation in which consumers have the <unk> choice
if the ldp as currently <unk> ca n't make the <unk> then it should split into two parties
one party could stand for consumer interests small government free trade and <unk> to put japan clearly among the most developed and open countries
the other party could continue on the traditional track of the ldp representing the manufacturers ' preference for larger government control <unk> and <unk>
the ldp must make a decision immediately lower house elections must take place before june

it 's a real <unk>
<unk> are getting into the variety act too
they still buy apples mainly for big red good looks that 's why so many <unk> like <unk> ' <unk> <unk>
but <unk> counts more than it once did and stores are expanding shelf space for <unk> but <unk> and often <unk> apples
rather than sell <unk> delicious maybe we can sell <unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> director for <unk> <unk> inc. a minneapolis <unk> chain and food <unk>
the fuji is a product of <unk> japanese <unk> engineering which <unk> it N years ago at a government research <unk>

the japanese apple market is very <unk> to high quality says david <unk> a scientist at a canadian <unk> research center in <unk> british columbia and so apples are more of a <unk> there than a big food commodity
the u.s. department of agriculture estimates that this year americans will eat about N N more fresh apples per <unk> than the japanese

i expect to see the demand exceed supply for <unk> for the next N to N years he adds
washington red delicious by the way are <unk> for less than $ N a box these days
mr. <unk> sees <unk> in part as striking a blow against the <unk> of u.s. apples by <unk>
when the chain stores took over there was no longer a connection between <unk> and consumer
a guy is sitting up in an office deciding what you 're going to eat
after all until the <unk> even the red delicious was a firm <unk> <unk>
then as <unk> <unk> them more for looks and to <unk> <unk> chains ' demands of long-term storage the red went into decline
now those red <unk> things stores sell in summer are <unk> <unk> but usually not good <unk>
they do <unk> <unk> however they are almost a year old probably equal to about N in human years
the fuji to be sure has <unk> too
it <unk> later than most apples and growing it in u.s. areas with <unk> <unk> may be <unk>
moreover the <unk> fuji must compete with an increasingly <unk> delicious
mr. <unk> the massachusetts <unk> says the big boss at a <unk> chain even rejected his red delicious recently because they were n't <unk> and <unk> for extra <unk>
and he had n't used <unk> which many <unk> <unk> to <unk> their delicious apples for greater eye appeal
still mr. <unk> points out <unk> became popular without big red looks so why not <unk>
he sees a shift in american values at least regarding apples toward more <unk> on <unk> and less on <unk>

few people are aware that the federal government <unk> almost as much money as it <unk>
from N to N while federal budget <unk> totaled $ N trillion the government issued $ N billion of new direct loans and an additional $ N billion of new primary loan guarantees
these figures <unk> secondary guarantees deposit insurance and the activities of <unk> enterprises a huge concern in its own right as detailed on this page may N
federal credit programs date back to the new deal and were meant to break even financially
since the <unk> federal lending has experienced extraordinary growth in credit volume <unk> rates and policy applications <unk> on by the growth of government in general and budget <unk> and <unk> management in particular
as we will see many of these <unk> do n't show up as part of the federal deficit
but recent events indicate that federal credit is out of control
student loan defaults remain high at about N N and the program has been <unk> by allegations of fraud and <unk>
farmers home administration <unk> loans have turned into de <unk> <unk> programs losses over the next three years are expected to exceed $ N billion
defaults on veterans affairs loan guarantees have <unk> in the past eight years
last month the general accounting office reported that defaults in federal housing administration guarantees were five times as high as previously estimated and that <unk> 's equity fell to <unk> $ N billion
<unk> 's findings are particularly <unk> because the <unk> has about $ N billion in <unk> outstanding and had previously been considered one of the most financially secure credit programs
<unk> of other credit programs <unk> agriculture small business <unk> defense energy transportation and others are less visible but in no better shape
if the programs continue their present path the potential government losses are <unk> the federal government holds $ N billion in direct loans outstanding and <unk> an additional $ N billion in primary guarantees
secondary guarantees of <unk> of <unk> and <unk> loans by the agency known as ginnie mae currently exceed $ N billion
although <unk> events have contributed to the <unk> the principal causes of the current crisis are internal and <unk> to all programs
to reduce the risks while still <unk> the legitimate benefits these programs can provide credit policy must N use credit to improve the operation of capital markets not to provide subsidies
there is a fundamental conflict between providing a <unk> and maintaining the <unk> of a credit program
if the program is meant to provide a <unk> <unk> the debt <unk> the original goal
thus <unk> loans tend to turn into <unk> programs with increasing <unk> and default rates over time
to avoid this problem government should issue credit only if it intends to use every legal method to <unk>
in contrast credit programs can be appropriate tools to improve the operation of capital markets
for example legal restrictions on interstate banking once <unk> the supply of credit to the <unk> sector
farm lending was enacted to correct this problem by providing a <unk> flow of <unk> funds
however this in no way <unk> the huge government subsidies and losses on such loans
credit policy should separate these two competing objectives and eliminate aspects that provide the <unk>
for example student loans currently attempt to <unk> college <unk> and <unk> problems created by the fact that students ' future earnings are not accepted as <unk>
the program provides highly <unk> loans to any student whose family <unk> less than a particular amount
high default rates a low interest rate and government coverage of all interest costs while the student is in school make program costs extremely high
families that do not need the loan can make money simply by putting the loan in the bank and paying it back when the student <unk>
in contrast a student loan program that was meant <unk> to correct <unk> <unk> would allow loans for any student <unk> of family income at market or <unk> rates
while the student was in school interest costs would either be paid by the student or added to the loan balance
this program combined with cash grants to <unk> students would reduce program costs and much more effectively target the intended beneficiaries
N provide better incentives
given the structure of most credit programs it is surprising that default rates are not even higher
guarantee rates are typically N N giving lenders little reason to screen customers carefully
reducing those rates <unk> say to N N would still provide substantial assistance to <unk>
but it would also encourage lenders to choose more <unk> customers and go a long way toward reducing defaults
for example the small business administration has had reasonable success in reducing both guarantee rates and default rates in its preferred lenders ' program
<unk> ' incentives are <unk> <unk>
since the government has a dismal record of <unk> bad debts the costs to the <unk> of <unk> are usually low
in addition it is often possible to obtain a new government loan even if existing debts are not paid off
simple policy <unk> in this case would be to improve debt collection taking the <unk> off <unk> collection agencies and to deny new credit to <unk>
these provisions would be difficult to <unk> for a program intended to provide a <unk> but would be reasonable and effective devices for programs that attempt to offset market <unk>
N record the true costs of credit programs in the federal budget
since the budget measures cash flow a new $ N direct loan is <unk> as a $ N <unk> even though at least part of the loan will be paid back
loan guarantees do n't appear at all until the <unk> defaults so new guarantees do not raise the deficit even though they create future liabilities for the government
by <unk> an <unk> or loan to a guarantee the government can ensure the same flow of resources and reduce the current deficit
<unk> guarantees outstanding have risen by $ N billion since N while direct loans outstanding have fallen by $ N billion
the true <unk> cost of a credit <unk> is the <unk> value of the net costs to government
this figure could be estimated using <unk> <unk> by private lenders to forecast losses or determined by selling loans to private owners without federal guarantees
neither technique is perfect but both are better than the current system which <unk> the costs of new credit programs by amounts that vary substantially and average about $ N billion annually according to the congressional budget office
a budget that reflected the real costs of lending would eliminate incentives to convert spending or lending programs to guarantees and would let taxpayers know what congress is <unk> them to
N <unk> standard accounting and administrative practices
creative accounting is a <unk> of federal credit
many agencies roll over their debt paying off <unk> loans by <unk> new loans or <unk> <unk> loan guarantees into direct loans
in any case they avoid having to write off the loans
some agencies simply keep bad loans on the books as late as N the <unk> bank held in its portfolio at face value loans made to cuba in the <unk>
more seriously <unk> has carried several billion dollars of <unk> loans at face value
until <unk> 's recent audit <unk> books had not been subject to a complete <unk> audit in N years
the administration of federal credit should closely <unk> private lending practices including the development of a loan loss reserve and regular outside <unk>
<unk> these practices would permit earlier <unk> of emerging financial <unk> provide better information for loan sales and <unk> decisions and reduce fraud
government lending was not intended to be a way to <unk> spending figures <unk> <unk> activity or provide large subsidies
the reforms described above would provide a more limited but <unk> safer and ultimately more <unk> role for government as a <unk>
without such reforms credit programs will continue to be a <unk> high-risk <unk> for taxpayers

it also says countries could temporarily raise <unk> on certain products if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports
instead of <unk> a complete <unk> of farm subsidies as the earlier u.s. proposal did the new package calls for the <unk> of only the most <unk> ones
less <unk> ones would be subject only to some <unk> and others with a relatively minor trade impact would be allowed to continue under certain conditions
the new u.s. plan also would establish procedures to prevent countries from using health and <unk> rules to <unk> trade <unk>

racial <unk> has been a familiar policy in new york city since N when congress first <unk> the voting rights act to expand its reach beyond the southern states
in N the justice department required that the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> be <unk> to concentrate black and <unk> votes despite <unk> that the new <unk> <unk> would split a neighborhood of <unk> <unk> into two different districts
this year a commission appointed by the mayor to <unk> new york 's system of government completed a new <unk> expanding the city council to N from N members
<unk> in N as soon as the N census becomes available a <unk> panel will <unk> the city council district lines
the <unk> <unk> commission has made it clear that in response to the expectations of the justice department and the commission 's own commitment to <unk> minority political leadership the new district lines will be <unk> to <unk> the number of <unk> minority districts
blacks and <unk> currently make up N N of the city 's population and hold only N N of the seats on the council
several of the city 's black leaders including democratic <unk> <unk> david dinkins have <unk> out for racial <unk> to accord blacks and <unk> the <unk> opportunity for <unk>
in this connection it is important to note that several members of new york 's sitting city council represent <unk> districts that bring together <unk> black <unk> and <unk> white <unk> <unk> <unk> 's <unk> district in northern manhattan and the south <unk> and <unk> alter 's <unk> district in <unk> for example
to win their seats on the council these political leaders have had to listen to all the <unk> in their district and <unk> public policies that would benefit all
often they have found that the <unk> issue is not race but rather housing crime <unk> or education
<unk> <unk>
the unusual situation in <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> consequences of <unk> out safe districts for racial minorities
in <unk> which is N N black whites are the minority
<unk> that they are protected by the voting rights act a group of whites brought a federal suit in N to demand that the city <unk> <unk> voting for the nine member city council and create nine <unk> districts including four safe white districts
the white group argued that whites were not fully and fairly represented because in <unk> elections only black candidates or white candidates who <unk> to black interests could win
no federal court has ruled that the voting rights act <unk> a white minority but in june the justice department approved a <unk> plan for <unk> that <unk> out three <unk> districts and six <unk> districts
richard <unk> <unk> 's black mayor <unk> the consequences
in the past people who had to run for office had to moderate their views because they could n't afford to <unk> blacks or whites he said
now you go to districts you 're likely to get candidates whose views are more <unk> white and black on racial issues
two hundred years ago critics of the new united states constitution warned that the <unk> districts for congress were too large and <unk> too many different economic interests
a small farmer and a <unk> merchant could not be represented by the same spokesman they said
but james <unk> <unk> that argument in one of the most <unk> political <unk> ever written no. N of the <unk> papers
<unk> explained that a representative 's duty was to speak not for the narrow interests of one group but instead for the common good
large <unk> election districts would encourage good government said <unk> because a representative would be <unk> to serve the interests of all his <unk> and be <unk> to none
<unk> 's <unk> and <unk> vision of the representative still can guide us
as long as we believe that all americans of every race and <unk> <unk> have common interests and can live together <unk> our political <unk> should reflect our belief
racial <unk> creating separate black and white districts says that we have <unk> that belief in our ability to live together and <unk> <unk> as one people
ms. <unk> is a constitutional <unk> at the center for the study of the <unk> in new york
the justice department has distributed these new guidelines for u.s. attorneys <unk> rico cases
a related editorial appears today
under rico the government may seek a temporary <unk> order <unk> upon the filing of a rico indictment in order to <unk> all <unk> assets until the trial is completed and judgment entered
such orders can have a <unk> impact on third parties who do business with the defendants including clients <unk> banks investors creditors <unk> and others
some highly <unk> cases involving rico <unk> have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press because of a <unk> that <unk> <unk> of assets is <unk> to a <unk> of property without due process
in order to ensure that the rights of all interested parties are protected the criminal division has <unk> the following requirements to control the use of <unk> in rico prosecutions
it should be noted that these requirements are in addition to any other existing requirements such as review by the asset forfeiture office
N as part of the approval process for rico prosecutions the prosecutor must submit any proposed forfeiture <unk> for review by the organized crime and racketeering section
the prosecutor must show that <unk> <unk> such as bonds are not likely to <unk> the assets for forfeiture in the event of a conviction
N in seeking approval of a <unk> the prosecutor must <unk> any anticipated impact that forfeiture and the <unk> would have on <unk> third parties <unk> against the government 's need to <unk> the assets
N in deciding whether forfeiture and <unk> a <unk> is appropriate the section will consider the nature and <unk> of the <unk> the government 's policy is not to seek the <unk> forfeiture <unk> under the law where that forfeiture would be <unk> to the <unk> 's crime
the division expects that the prosecutor will announce these <unk> either at the time the indictment is returned or at the latest at the first <unk> before the court concerning the <unk>
sales of north <unk> cars and trucks plunged N N in mid-october from a year earlier as domestic manufacturers paid the price for heavy incentives earlier this year
people are waiting for new factory <unk> said <unk> <unk> sales manager of bob <unk> auto world in <unk> mass. whose sales are slow
this trend appears to be especially true at general motors corp. which used both dealer and consumer incentives to <unk> sales in august and september
since then <unk> have <unk>
gm 's car sales dropped N N in mid-october to N while truck sales fell N N to N
gm also had dismal results in the first N days of the month while other auto makers reported mixed results
all of the big three suffered in the <unk> period however with sales of all <unk> made cars including those built at <unk> plants falling N N to N from a year earlier
the seasonal adjusted annual selling rate was six million vehicles a small improvement from the N million rate of early october but a big drop from the N million rate a year ago
sales of <unk> made trucks also continued to be sluggish in mid-october dropping N N to N from a year ago
the big three auto makers already have <unk> fourth-quarter production plans N N below year-ago levels but that may not be enough to prevent inventories from <unk> if sales do n't improve
industry analyst john h. <unk> a vice president with hill & <unk> in st. louis forecasts that domestic auto makers will have a <unk> supply of cars at the end of the year even if car sales improve to a N million vehicle rate for the quarter
ford motor co. reported a N N drop in sales of <unk> cars to N and a N N drop in domestic trucks to N
the sales are being <unk> down by a <unk> of N vehicles said <unk> <unk> a ford analyst

short interest in nasdaq over-the-counter stocks rose N N as of mid-october its biggest jump since N N last april
the most recent otc short interest statistics were compiled oct. N the day the nasdaq composite index slid N N and the new york stock exchange tumbled N N
the <unk> might lead to the <unk> that <unk> bet heavily on that day that otc stocks would decline further
as it <unk> the nasdaq composite did continue to fall for two days after the initial plunge
however the short interest figures reported by brokerage and securities clearing firms to the national association of securities dealers include only those trades completed or settled by oct. N rather than trades that occurred on that day according to gene <unk> chief economist for the <unk>
generally it takes five business days to transfer stock and to take the other steps necessary to settle a trade
the total short interest in nasdaq stocks as of mid-october was N million shares up from N million in september but well below the record level of N million shares established in july N
the sharp rise in otc short interest compares with the N N decline in short interest on the new york stock exchange and the N N rise on the american stock exchange during the <unk> period
generally a short seller expects a fall in a stock 's price and <unk> to profit by selling borrowed shares that are to be replaced later the short seller hopes the replacement shares bought later will cost less than those that were sold
short interest which represents the number of shares borrowed and sold but not yet replaced can be a <unk> <unk> for many stocks
among N of the largest otc issues short interest rose to N million shares from N million in N stocks in september
big stocks with large short interest gains as of oct. N included first executive intel campeau and lin broadcasting
short interest in first executive an insurance issue rose N N to N million
intel 's short interest jumped N N while campeau 's increased N N
intel makes <unk> and campeau operates <unk> chains and is <unk> for cash
<unk> savings again had the <unk> <unk> of being the otc stock with the biggest short interest position on nasdaq
<unk> has headed the list since may
first executive and troubled valley national corp. of arizona were next in line
short selling is n't necessarily bad for the overall market
<unk> shares must eventually be replaced through buying
in addition changes in short interest in some stocks may be caused by arbitrage
for example an investor may seek to profit during some takeover <unk> by buying stock in one company involved and <unk> the stock of the other
two big stocks involved in takeover activity saw their short interest surge
short interest in the american depositary receipts of jaguar the target of both ford motor and general motors more than doubled
nasdaq stocks that showed a drop in short interest included <unk> systems class a shares of tele-communications and takeover targets <unk> and <unk>

short interest in N <unk> securities totaled N million shares compared with almost N million shares in N issues in september
the october short interest represents N days of average daily trading volume in the smaller stocks in the system for the reporting period compared with N day a month ago
among bigger otc stocks the figures represent N days of average daily volume compared with N days in september
the <unk> <unk> show the issues in which a short interest position of at least N shares <unk> as of oct. N or in which there was a short position change of at least N shares since sept. N see <unk> <unk> <unk> oct. N N

what <unk> general <unk> was not only the weight of the <unk> army
the weight of lebanon 's history was also against him and it is a history israel is in danger of <unk>
like lebanon and however <unk> israel is regarded by the arab world as a <unk> <unk>
its best hope of acceptance by its <unk> lies in <unk> a settlement with the <unk>
like lebanon israel is being <unk> by <unk>
in greater israel more than half the children under six are <unk>
within N years <unk> will probably be the minority
yet israel will neither share power with all these <unk> nor says its present prime minister <unk> its <unk> closer to its <unk> <unk> <unk>
by not <unk> one of these options <unk> will <unk> themselves as the <unk> did to <unk> war with the <unk> in their <unk> and so to the internal <unk> of their state
unlike the <unk> israel 's <unk> will not let themselves become the <unk> force in a system of private <unk> <unk> will become <unk> before it becomes <unk>
but that is not much of a <unk> to draw from the failure of general <unk>
the nasdaq over-the-counter market did n't fully recover from a selling <unk> and closed down N N

the market started with several <unk> against it said peter <unk> head of retail equity trading at shearson lehman hutton referring to news that the labor-management buy-out of ual corp. continued to <unk> and reports that the junk-bond market is <unk>
but the <unk> selling in response to those developments <unk> a serious blow to the over-the-counter market mr. <unk> said
even though the over-the-counter market usually does n't fall by as much as listed stocks during <unk> <unk> he said when the market does recover the damage is done and it leaves nasdaq down more than the big board
mr. <unk> also complained that the sharp swings in stock prices <unk> is <unk> away retail and foreign investors
while shearson does n't do <unk> program trading for its own account the firm does <unk> orders for clients involved in the buying and selling of shares tied to movements in certain stock <unk> mr. <unk> acknowledged
the volatility <unk> in program trading troubled other traders too
they do n't like the risks they are forced to assume when prices <unk> so <unk>
market makers are supposed to keep supplies of stocks on hand to maintain <unk> trading when <unk> <unk>
that means that on days when prices are <unk> and sellers <unk> they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will
in such an environment a market maker can absorb huge losses
but the recent volatility in stock prices caused by the program trading has made some market makers less willing to <unk> up the stocks that are for sale
the market makers say they are n't comfortable carrying big positions in stocks because they realize prices can <unk> quickly
the situation makes it harder to buy and sell shares quickly <unk> the rise and fall in stock prices during <unk> trading

arms control reality nov. N N the first of some N journal <unk> saying that <unk> violated the abm treaty
whether the <unk> is for early warning or space track it clearly is not <unk> the lawmakers said
thus we judge it to be not a violation of the abm treaty at this time
the delegation included a reporter from the new york times <unk> to sen. edward m. kennedy and rep. <unk> <unk> and natural resources defense council staff members
the washington post sept. N N
the <unk> has taken unprecedented <unk> measures of <unk> by giving american representatives a possibility to <unk> the building site of the <unk> <unk> as well as <unk> <unk> in the areas of <unk> and moscow so as to see for themselves that there are no violations of the abm treaty of N on the part of the soviet union
letter from <unk> shevardnadze to <unk> <unk> <unk> de <unk> reported in <unk> june N N
the construction of this station equal in size to the <unk> <unk> <unk> i say it directly a clear violation of abm
<unk> shevardnadze oct. N N
we 're happy we guess to receive <unk> of the <unk> violation from the soviets five years after we started writing about it
perhaps even the american <unk> will now <unk>
without question something <unk> is going on in the policy <unk> of the politburo
as it bids for new agreements new loans and indeed <unk> to the <unk> world the soviet government has <unk> it has a credibility problem
so after N years it is <unk> the obvious hoping to be believed about other things
it 's not enough
if the soviets want to be believed they need to start telling the truth about more than the totally obvious
our own test of <unk> 's <unk> would be a soviet decision to open itself to a complete international <unk> of one of the most <unk> <unk> in <unk> relations the reported N <unk> <unk> at a soviet military facility in <unk>
the u.s. government has never <unk> in its assessment of this <unk> as an accident at a <unk> weapons facility there and <unk> a violation of the N <unk> weapons <unk>
the pentagon 's recently issued soviet military power though in general <unk> a <unk> line repeated the <unk> assessment
it also was detailed in congressional <unk> this past february an <unk> at the <unk> and <unk> institute in <unk> released <unk> <unk> that caused a significant number of deaths
since mr. shevardnadze did not address this topic before the supreme soviet the soviet union 's official position remains that the <unk> deaths were caused by <unk> <unk>
we doubt this claim just as we <unk> mr. shevardnadze 's <unk> last year that <unk> did n't <unk> the abm treaty
and just as we did not believe the <unk> claims of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> who visited <unk> we are in no way <unk> by the <unk> to the <unk> theory by a u.s. team of scientists who met with soviet <unk> in washington last year
the soviets ' <unk> is that the <unk> came from one lot of <unk> feed made from the <unk> of cattle that <unk> on <unk> that was naturally infected with <unk> <unk>
harvard 's <unk> <unk> who we read has sold something called the scientific community on the notion that <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> were in fact the result of <unk> <unk> by giant <unk> found the soviet <unk> scenario completely <unk>
we do n't believe it
and we certainly do not believe that mr. gorbachev or any of his <unk> yet <unk> to have the west take their word for it
<unk> is a large gray <unk> over <unk> and indeed over the <unk> of the <unk> process itself
the u.s. government 's <unk> complaint as with <unk> is no <unk> political <unk>
<unk> weapons violations have figured little in political debate and indeed have not been <unk> <unk> enough by the u.s. government
but the stated u.s. position is detailed and specific and the prospect of <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk>
the soviets should be willing to set in motion a process that would allow them to <unk> that <unk> violated the N agreement or <unk> that would give u.s. specialists reasonable confidence that this was a <unk> <unk> accident
until that <unk> <unk> can not begin to <unk> the kind of credibility mr. shevardnadze was bidding for with his <unk> on monday

since most of its assets are tied to manville a forest and building products concern the trust might also want to <unk> its holdings

that was when the <unk> old <unk> ' party <unk> to live through the crisis broke <unk> with the communists and joined with solidarity in the east bloc 's first <unk> government
but by the time solidarity took office in september the damage was done
<unk> as economists have come to call it had gone <unk>
the cost of raising a <unk> kept <unk> ahead of the return for selling one
the farmers stayed angry
they still are

a private market like this just is n't big enough to absorb all that business
the <unk> of <unk> it seems will not quickly <unk> away

yet the state alone sells <unk> and machines
when supplies are short it often hands them over only in exchange for milk or grain
a private farmer in poland is free to buy and sell land hire help decide what to grow and how to grow it

the house approved a short-term spending bill to keep the government operating through nov. N and provide $ N billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from hurricane hugo and the california earthquake
the N roll call vote reflected broad support for the disaster assistance but the cost to the treasury is sure to <unk> budget pressures this year and next under the <unk> deficit reduction law
by a <unk> N margin the chamber rejected an effort to <unk> <unk> for purposes of <unk> the two disasters and budget analysts estimate the increased appropriations will <unk> the fiscal N deficit by at least $ N billion unless <unk> spending cuts or new revenues are found by congress
the budget impact will be greater still in fiscal N and the issue forced a <unk> between the appropriations committee leadership and budget committee chairman <unk> <unk> whose california district was at the center of the earthquake last week
going to the well of the chamber mr. <unk> <unk> the costs be fully <unk>
his <unk> role put him in the <unk> position of <unk> the very committee members on whom his state will be most <unk> in the months ahead
we do not come to this house asking for any <unk> said the california democrat
we do not <unk> to <unk> these costs from the american people
the $ N billion package <unk> $ N million for <unk> disaster loans $ N billion in highway construction funds and $ N billion divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to president bush to meet <unk> costs from the two disasters
the funds are in addition to $ N billion <unk> last month to assist in the recovery from hugo bringing the total for the two disasters to nearly $ N billion in <unk> spending
because of the <unk> of <unk> the immediate impact is relatively small
but the appropriations set in motion spending that adds to an already <unk> budget picture for fiscal N
within the appropriations process the situation is even more difficult since the costs will be <unk> against the share of funds to be <unk> to those <unk> that recently have had the greatest difficulty in <unk> within the budget
the underlying bill approved yesterday is required to keep the government operating past <unk> <unk> and this <unk> has contributed to the speed and critics say <unk> that have <unk> the package of disaster assistance
the <unk> <unk> measure could hurt california by requiring it to put up more matching funds for emergency highway assistance than otherwise would be required
and the state 's delegation is <unk> that the new funding will be <unk> against a separate $ N million in federal highway funds it would expect to receive under its normal <unk> this year
also the high price of san francisco real estate puts the state at odds with federal regulations more <unk> to the national average
for example disaster loans which will go to small businesses and homeowners offer credit as low as N N in some cases
but the san francisco delegation finds itself asking that the cap per household be <unk> to $ N from $ N to assist the hard hit but often <unk> marina district
the senate is expected to make some <unk> today but both the white house and congress appear most <unk> to speed final approval before <unk> 's deadline
administration pressure <unk> any effort to add to total funding and the senate changes are expected to be largely technical dealing with highway aid and <unk> the ceiling on total small business administration loans to $ N billion to <unk> the increased activity expected
yesterday 's floor action came as a house-senate conference approved a nearly $ N billion fiscal N military construction bill representing a N N reduction from last year and making severe cuts from pentagon <unk> for <unk> abroad
an estimated $ N million is <unk> to continue work in <unk>
but all funding is cut for the <unk> and projects in south korea are cut to $ N million or less than a <unk> of the administration 's request
closer to home the <unk> were more <unk>
an estimated $ N million was set aside for military <unk> in the home state of north carolina rep. <unk> <unk> the house chairman
and $ N million would go to projects in tennessee represented by his senate <unk> and fellow democrat sen. james <unk>
texas and california are traditionally powerful within the conference but <unk> striking is the <unk> of <unk> pennsylvania and west virginia because of their power elsewhere in the appropriations process
senate appropriations committee chairman robert <unk> d. <unk> even added report language <unk> $ N million in projects he wants in the budget next year
no individual <unk> this mix of power more yesterday than sen. daniel <unk> d. <unk> who <unk> the senate defense subcommittee
in the final trading the house was <unk> on setting aside $ N million to carry out base <unk> ordered to begin in fiscal N
but it gave ground to mr. <unk> on a number of projects ranging from a $ N million parking <unk> here to a land transfer in <unk> to a provision to assist the <unk> indian <unk> in washington state
the <unk> is one of the <unk> in the pacific <unk>
mr. <unk> who <unk> the select committee on indian affairs used his power to move $ N from the air force to the bureau of indian affairs to assist in <unk> a <unk> base to <unk> a drug and <unk> <unk> center
meanwhile house-senate <unk> have tentatively agreed on a $ N billion <unk> and <unk> <unk> cutting other federal spending N N to pay for it
a formal house-senate conference is expected to <unk> the accord later this week
mobil corp. is preparing to <unk> the size of its work force in the u.s. possibly as soon as next month say individuals familiar with the company 's strategy
the size of the cuts is n't known but they 'll be <unk> in the exploration and production division which is responsible for <unk> oil reserves <unk> wells and <unk> crude oil and natural gas
employees have n't yet been notified
sources said that meetings to discuss the staff reductions have been scheduled for friday at mobil offices in new <unk> and denver
this would be a second round of cuts by mobil which along with other oil producers and <unk> reduced its work force by N N to N N during the <unk> as part of an <unk> <unk>
mobil 's latest move could signal the beginning of further reductions by other oil companies in their domestic <unk> operations
in yesterday 's third-quarter earnings report the company <unk> to a $ N million provision for restructuring costs involving u.s. exploration and production operations
the report says that the restructuring will take place over a two-year period and will <unk> involve the transfer and <unk> of employees in our u.s. operations
a company spokesman reached at his home last night would only say that there will be a public announcement of the reduction program by the end of the week
most oil companies including mobil have been reporting lower third-quarter earnings largely as a result of lower earnings from chemicals as well as refining and marketing businesses
individuals familiar with mobil 's strategy say that mobil is reducing its u.s. work force because of declining u.s. output
yesterday mobil said domestic exploration and production operations had a $ N million loss in the third quarter while comparable foreign operations earned $ N million
<unk> oil production in this country fell by N barrels a day to N million barrels in the first eight months of this year
daily output is expected to decline by at least another N barrels next year
some mobil executives were <unk> that a <unk> to the <unk> was included in the earnings report before workers were notified
one mobil executive said that the $ N million charge related to the action indicates a substantial number of people will be involved
some will likely be offered <unk> packages while others will be transferred to overseas operations
the justice department is in the process of trying to gain control over a law that federal judge david <unk> recently called a <unk>
<unk> to say he was talking about rico
with its recently revised guidelines for rico justice makes it clear that the law currently holds too many incentives for <unk> by prosecutors
the <unk> of the new policy guidelines from the criminal division are <unk> nearby
they strongly suggest that justice 's prosecutions of drexel burnham lambert michael <unk> and <unk> violated <unk> of fundamental <unk>
justice is attempting to avoid a <unk> of these <unk>
this amounts to an extraordinary <unk> of the <unk> of new york <unk> candidate and former u.s. attorney <unk> giuliani who was more <unk> to <unk> <unk> than <unk> markets
the new guidelines limit the <unk> <unk> of assets of <unk> defendants and their investors clients bankers and others
this follows earlier new guidelines from the tax division <unk> <unk> tax cases from <unk> as rico cases
the forfeiture <unk> cited considerable criticism in the press because of a <unk> that <unk> <unk> of assets is <unk> to a <unk> of property without due process
it told prosecutors not to seek <unk> if there are less <unk> alternatives such as bonds and in any case not to seek <unk> <unk> to the <unk> 's crime
these changes come a <unk> late for <unk> the first <unk> securities firm
it was forced into <unk> before trial when investors <unk> their funds after the government <unk> a huge <unk> asset forfeiture
<unk> investors including <unk> & co. and the harvard <unk> made the <unk> decision to <unk> their money for the firm the <unk> was sentence first <unk> later
prosecutors wanted $ N million in forfeiture for alleged tax fraud of some $ N
the experience of <unk> and <unk> of other <unk> cases against legitimate businesses <unk> drexel that a <unk> investment bank would be an <unk> bank
drexel therefore agreed instead to an arrangement allowing it to plea to charges which the company is not in a position to dispute because of rico
part of drexel 's plea was to cut mr. <unk> loose
so after all the <unk> <unk> no one has established what if anything drexel did wrong
so two <unk> for the new rules
justice has finally <unk> its employees ' <unk> thanks largely to the demands for reform by former u.s. attorney in washington joseph <unk> who wants to <unk> rico for real <unk>
but <unk> guidelines are effective only if someone at justice is willing and able to <unk> <unk> prosecutors
judge <unk> of the appeals court in washington made this point at a <unk> institute conference last week in a <unk> speech <unk> rico the <unk> that <unk> <unk>
he said <unk> is supposed to be a government of laws not of men and yet rico <unk> tell us that we should rely on <unk> <unk> to protect against <unk> of rico
no <unk> guidelines <unk> or <unk> limit civil rico cases by plaintiffs for damages
what now for <unk> officials drexel and mr. <unk>
justice should review these cases to see what other <unk> <unk> may have occurred
we suspect that justice will some day agree that only the complete repeal of rico can guarantee an end to <unk> in its name

but orders for <unk> capital goods a <unk> of future plant and equipment spending were off N N after falling N N in august
auto makers reported that mid-october sales were running at an annual rate of about N million units far less than the N million units analysts had expected
taken together the <unk> and <unk> reports confirmed <unk> that the economy is <unk> down

just when ms. <unk> sat down away from her <unk> to <unk> in private her <unk> began <unk> around the stage her country <unk> also has a very active set of <unk>
hold on to those <unk> <unk> you wanted to caution her as the sets started to roll around once more
this is the most moving <unk> i 've ever seen
normally <unk> can go about her business without <unk> whether she is moving as <unk> as the <unk>

<unk> <unk> used to hold the <unk> belief that it was more perfect to exist than not to exist and that to exist as a matter of <unk> was most perfect of all
now only <unk> <unk> as a matter of <unk> <unk> it is built into his nature
but since the time of <unk> we <unk> could at least claim a sort of natural <unk> for the <unk> of our <unk>
are n't we after all the <unk> <unk> of that <unk> <unk> called <unk>
if <unk> and natural <unk> <unk> but <unk> give rise to more and more advanced forms of life then it was only a matter of <unk> before <unk> <unk> <unk> with reason <unk> and <unk> <unk> onto the scene
now along comes stephen <unk> gould to <unk> this <unk> <unk>
his <unk> are <unk> for the task
star <unk> at harvard author of numerous popular books on science and <unk> of the <unk> <unk> mr. gould is perhaps the world 's most <unk> <unk> <unk>
yet he puts quite a <unk> on the old story <unk> down from <unk>
for him natural history is anything but a <unk> <unk> march from <unk> <unk> to human <unk> it is a <unk> <unk> affair in which the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> was a <unk> shot
in <unk> life the <unk> <unk> and the nature of history <unk> N pages $ N mr. gould makes his case for the <unk> <unk> of human <unk>
the argument turns on the <unk> in N of an <unk> <unk> <unk> high in the canadian <unk> called the <unk> <unk>
here in an area smaller than a city block lay <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that had <unk> more than N million years ago <unk> whose <unk> variety far exceeded what can be found in all the world 's <unk> today
such an <unk> of <unk> was <unk> to the man who discovered the <unk> <unk> one charles <unk> <unk>
the received <unk> <unk> of the day said that animals living so long ago must be simple in design limited in <unk> and <unk> to <unk> <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> in such a way that they could be <unk> into familiar categories
it was not until the early 1970s that <unk> <unk> harry <unk> and two sharp <unk> students began to publish a <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
by making <unk> <unk> about how the <unk> and <unk> <unk> remains <unk> to <unk> structures this <unk> was able to piece together a series of <unk> <unk> quite unlike anything currently on the planet
one was so <unk> in <unk> it was dubbed <unk>
would that mr. gould 's <unk> <unk> of these <unk> was always so <unk>
a good deal of the book is <unk> particularly the <unk> <unk> to high and <unk> culture and the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk>
these turns do not provide sufficient relief from <unk> like most modern <unk> have six <unk> <unk> on the <unk>
interest <unk> up though when mr. gould gets around to discussing the meaning of the <unk> <unk> for the theory of <unk>
not long after the <unk> of life <unk> there was an <unk> <unk> in the number of <unk> designs seen on the earth
the vast majority of them however were <unk> out by a <unk> of environmental <unk> that were too sudden and <unk> for the normal rules of natural <unk> to operate
<unk> the <unk> process was like a <unk> in which each group held a ticket <unk> to its <unk> <unk>
so much for <unk> of the <unk>
so much too for the notion that we <unk> <unk> in the <unk> struggle by <unk> big <unk>
our <unk> <unk> <unk> out through the <unk> impact that did in the <unk> because they were small not <unk>
if anyone has difficulty <unk> a world in which history went <unk> on without us mr. gould <unk> several
in one <unk> are the dominant <unk> in another the <unk> <unk> with little <unk>
back when the <unk> <unk> were <unk> it seems human <unk> hopes <unk> on the <unk> of a little worm with a <unk> called <unk>
mr. gould finds this <unk> <unk> like an <unk> of old he views our <unk> as a source of both freedom and <unk> <unk> responsibility
i by contrast can not help feeling that if some other <unk> from the <unk> <unk> had <unk> instead <unk> at once <unk> and less <unk> than <unk> <unk> might have eventually gained <unk> <unk>
but even if no <unk> life had <unk> here at all the <unk> is a big place and given the right conditions <unk> to creating some form of life
<unk> at some other <unk> address a <unk> <unk> would have risen out of the <unk> to explain why <unk> <unk> it is indeed a <unk> life
mr. <unk> is a columnist for the <unk> review in london
the justice department <unk> to play down the <unk> of its new guidelines concerning prosecutions under the federal racketeering law
the guidelines were distributed to u.s. attorneys last summer but were disclosed for the first time by press reports this week
they <unk> prosecutors under certain circumstances from seeking court orders <unk> the assets of racketeering defendants prior to trial
but david <unk> chief justice department spokesman said the guidelines are a <unk> and a <unk> far more than a new direction
use of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> organizations law against <unk> defendants as opposed to alleged <unk> figures has come under attack from some defense lawyers and legal <unk>
critics have complained that the law <unk> <unk> defendants of assets before a jury <unk> they have committed a crime and that aggressive use of the forfeiture provisions can <unk> corporate defendants or force them into <unk> plea <unk>
in the new guidelines the justice department says that in attempting to <unk> <unk> assets before trial the government will not seek to <unk> the normal legitimate business activities of the <unk> and will not seek to take from third parties assets <unk> transferred to them
the guidelines also state the government 's policy is not to seek the <unk> forfeiture <unk> under the law where that forfeiture would be <unk> to the <unk> 's crime
another provision <unk> certain limits on when prosecutors may use <unk> charges as a basis for bringing a racketeering case
mr. <unk> declined to <unk> on whether the guidelines would curb racketeering prosecutions against corporate defendants
the impact if there is any will be impossible to judge ahead of time because the decision whether to use racketeering charges is made in individual cases by justice department officials in washington he said
in a <unk> <unk> the guidelines assistant attorney general edward dennis jr. said that government efforts to <unk> defendants ' assets pending racketeering prosecutions have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press
but mr. <unk> said the government is n't backing off on these kinds of matters at all

the talk of a sales tax rise follows a <unk> from congress on the question of how much the federal government is willing to spend to aid in california 's earthquake relief efforts
the state had sought as much as $ N billion in relief but yesterday the house approved a more general <unk> measure calling for $ N billion in aid the bulk of which would go to california with an <unk> amount going to <unk> affected by hurricane hugo

<unk> brown speaker of california 's assembly said that gov. george <unk> has agreed to schedule a special session of the legislature within two weeks

both mr. brown the state 's most <unk> <unk> and gov. <unk> favor a temporary sales tax increase should more money be needed than the state can raise from existing sources and the federal government
according to a spokesman the governor is also studying the possibility of raising state gasoline taxes
mr. brown meanwhile believes only one tax will be <unk> and it will be a <unk> sales tax increase said <unk> <unk> an aide
one immediate source of money is an emergency fund set up by gov. <unk>
the fund has about $ N billion and is set up to handle <unk> the kind of emergency the state faces said tom <unk> the governor 's deputy press secretary
but the fund 's size is <unk> by mr. brown 's office which estimates the fund holds from $ N million to $ N million
moreover an aide to mr. brown said gov. <unk> has expressed a desire not to spend all the reserve on this
to push through a sales tax increase however the state will have to <unk> the <unk> limit citing an emergency
and then it will be required to lower taxes by a <unk> amount during a <unk> period after the temporary tax increase ends said <unk> katz assistant director of the state department of finance
a sales tax increase would require two-thirds approval in both houses of the state 's legislature
but observers expect broad support
if there 's an emergency and there are n't sufficient funds from elsewhere i think the attitude will be <unk> said <unk> west president of the california chamber of commerce
but others think property owners ought to pay a higher portion of the state 's earthquake relief <unk>
since the late 1970s california property owners have benefited from a tax <unk> as a result of a state <unk> initiative known as <unk> N
the state could also increase gasoline taxes every one <unk> increase in the tax would yield $ N million a month
but gov. <unk> and others are reluctant to do anything to <unk> the state 's <unk> of sharply raising gasoline taxes on a permanent basis
to raise more highway funds a measure to double the state 's <unk> a <unk> tax over five years is set to appear on the state 's june election <unk>
but some fear <unk> a temporary gasoline tax increase in the <unk> could <unk> support among voters for the measure
not everyone is convinced the state must raise new revenue to meet its earthquake needs
it 's possible though not <unk> that the state could get by with its existing resources and federal help said <unk> <unk> chairman of the state senate 's transportation committee
separately two men injured in last week 's <unk> freeway collapse in oakland began a legal battle against the state over whether officials <unk> <unk> <unk> about the structure 's safety
the claims which were filed with the state board of control but will probably end up in court are the first <unk> out of the collapse of the so-called <unk> structure <unk>
the men can <unk> <unk> that states often <unk> in court by showing that officials knew or should have known that design of the structure was <unk> and that they failed to make reasonable changes

the airline industry 's <unk> in <unk> shape for most of the year have taken a sudden turn for the worse in the past few weeks
citing rising fuel costs promotional fare cuts and a general slowdown in travel several major carriers have posted or are expected to post relatively poor third-quarter results
yesterday usair group inc. recently one of the industry 's <unk> <unk> posted a <unk> $ N million net loss for the period
so far the industry 's fourth quarter is n't looking too strong either <unk> many analysts to <unk> <unk> projections for the rest of the year by as much as <unk>
and they say the outlook for N is nearly as bad
airlines in N came in like a <unk> and are going out like a <unk> said <unk> <unk> an airline analyst at morgan stanley & co
this turn of events has put a big <unk> on an industry that seemed almost <unk> last spring when fares were rising at <unk> rates and many carriers seemed to be growing fat on <unk> in certain markets
now many airline companies might become a lot less attractive as takeover targets on wall street
the downturn also raises questions about the carriers ' ambitious orders for new <unk> which currently total $ N billion over the next three years
for travelers though the industry 's problems have had some positive effects
in recent weeks airlines have cut numerous fares in <unk> markets to try to win back customers
others have tried to <unk> up <unk> programs
previously airlines were <unk> the programs because they were becoming too expensive
just last week for example <unk> world airlines and pan am corp. 's pan american world airways went so far as to offer cash <unk> or <unk> checks of $ N to $ N to certain <unk> members making <unk> flights in business class or first class
the industry 's slowdown became apparent this month when amr corp. parent of american airlines reported an N N drop in third-quarter net income and said its fourth quarter would be disappointing
shortly before that usair had said its third-quarter results would be significantly lower than a year earlier
yesterday it provided the details
its loss of $ N million or $ N a share <unk> with net of $ N million or $ N a share in the N third quarter

for the nine months the <unk> va. company 's net plunged N N to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or $ N a share
revenue rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion
the results surprised many analysts because usair has almost no competition in its pittsburgh <unk> and has expanded operations by <unk> its acquisition of <unk> airlines
shortly after announcing its quarterly loss usair 's stock tumbled $ N a share
it ended at $ N down $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading
nobody was expecting this size of a loss said paul <unk> an analyst with first boston corp
one airline executive who declined to be identified called the loss <unk>
in announcing the results usair cited many of the same problems that several other industry officials have named recently
it said the industry 's domestic traffic was flat in the third quarter analysts say this was because hefty fare increases earlier in the year <unk> off many <unk> travelers this summer
to try to <unk> the traffic slowdown airlines started reducing fares average fares rose only N N in august in contrast to increases of N N each in february and march
but so far the effort has failed and traffic is still slow
some other fare promotions have <unk>
this summer the industry introduced a kids fly free program in which children were allowed to fly free if they were <unk> with an <unk>
airlines tried to restrict the program substantially by <unk> the offer to certain days of the week but it still was apparently used far more heavily than the airlines expected
airlines also say their <unk> programs are <unk> profits because <unk> are being <unk> at a <unk> rate
one airline official said about three times as many <unk> <unk> are being turned in as in previous years not surprisingly as the airlines last year allowed many travelers to build up <unk> at <unk> the normal rate
rising operating expenses are another problem
fuel costs were up N N in the third quarter
labor costs which <unk> off in the past few years because of lower pay <unk> for <unk> employees are on the <unk> again at many carriers
and some carriers are facing other <unk> <unk> usair for example blamed some of its loss on merger expenses and on <unk> caused by hurricane hugo last month
we can not <unk> the total <unk> effects of hugo said <unk> <unk> chairman and president of usair group
whatever the cause for the downturn few people are predicting any sudden improvement

but then steady <unk> buying by bear stearns & co. which frequently buys stock for corporate <unk> took hold and <unk> the fall in ual which eventually <unk> the entire market
the industrial average closed down only N points at N
late in the afternoon several big purchases by bear stearns particularly a block of N shares at N p.m. at $ N a share triggered a buying <unk> that took ual up more than N points in the final hour of trading
ual stock closed at $ N a share down $ N
volume was a <unk> N million shares or N N of the N million ual shares outstanding
traders estimated that bear stearns bought more than N million shares
the two most frequently <unk> buyers neither of whom would comment were <unk> partners which <unk> the ual board in N and new york real estate developer donald trump who recently made and withdrew an offer for american airlines parent amr corp
however one person familiar with ual said the signs pointed to <unk> because mr. trump has n't asked for permission to buy more than $ N million of stock under federal antitrust rules
<unk> traders <unk> by their huge losses in ual stock remained eager for some action by an outside <unk> following the collapse oct. N of a $ 300-a-share $ N billion labor-management buy-out
their hope was that the <unk> would seek to <unk> the board in a solicitation of shareholder <unk>
baker <unk> investments a new york <unk> trader that owns ual stock would n't comment on reports the firm is considering seeking such a shareholder vote
but partner richard <unk> said this is the most extraordinary failed transaction i 've seen in N years in this business
it would make sense for somebody to do it
i have never seen a case of <unk> <unk> by so many participants
in N baker <unk> <unk> a <unk> fight for control of <unk> transportation inc. that ultimately led to <unk> 's being sold
some traders pointed <unk> to earlier estimates by ual 's investment adviser first boston corp. that <unk> could yield $ N to $ N a share
but those would require pilots ' cooperation
any investor who <unk> ual stock in an attempt to force a buy-out or recapitalization must deal with united 's <unk> unions
the pilots are working under an <unk> contract and the machinists contract expires next month
that gives them enormous <unk> including the threat of a strike to block any buy-out or recapitalization attempt they oppose
however a <unk> like <unk> could seek shareholder support for a sale to a labor-management group at the last price discussed by that group before the board meeting monday
the pilots had been working on a buy-out bid between $ N and $ N a share or $ N billion to $ N billion
one person familiar with ual said the <unk> labor situation and the uncertain world-wide financial markets contributed to the board 's decision to avoid <unk> around selling the company at a <unk> price particularly since it accepted a $ 300-a-share offer just last month
even some <unk> traders said they could n't <unk> with the board 's <unk>
but the board 's decision prompted many to <unk> out of the stock yesterday
we had a lot of people who <unk> in the <unk> today said <unk> <unk> a partner in <unk> jacobson & sons a specialist in trading ual stock on the big board
another trader noted that many arbitrage firms are afraid to sell their ual stock at the bottom but already own so much they ca n't buy any more
this deal is like a <unk> <unk> he said
they check in but they ca n't check out
but both the traders and the pilots remain interested in some transaction
so too according to many reports is british airways plc despite its public withdrawal from the buy-out
the pilots might end up <unk> up with their longtime <unk> the machinists union in a recapitalization
the machinists are reviewing proposals they made in the past for <unk> that would pay a special shareholder dividend and give employees a minority stake
the company rejected those past proposals
it is <unk> however if the machinists would support a majority stake as the pilots want
a <unk> official said that would <unk> on how much in concessions machinists would have to give in return for the majority stake
some investors whose names were <unk> about by traders as potential ual stock buyers said they were n't buying
i 'm not interested said dallas investor harold simmons
a source close to <unk> icahn a corporate raider who owns <unk> world airlines inc. said he has n't owned any ual stock and is n't buying
one person familiar with texas <unk> robert <unk> said he is n't likely to make any hostile moves
and a spokesman for <unk> group holdings inc. which had held N N of ual before the first buy-out bid but later reduced its holdings below N N would n't comment
marvin davis whose $ N billion takeover bid originally put the nation 's second-largest airline in play is limited by a <unk> agreement with ual he signed in september
the los angeles investor ca n't buy ual stock <unk> shareholder <unk> or make a new offer unless he makes a formal offer of $ N a share or ual <unk> an offer below $ N
however mr. davis could pressure the board by asking that the agreement be <unk> or letting it be known that he has financing for an offer at a lower price
times <unk> co. said third-quarter net income fell N N to $ N million or N cents a share compared with net income of $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier
the los angeles media concern said that the year-ago period included a $ N million gain from the sale of assets primarily <unk>
revenue was $ N million up N N from $ N million
stronger results from the company 's broadcast and cable television units and professional and <unk> publishing divisions plus increased advertising at the company 's largest newspaper the los angeles times offset advertising declines in the company 's newspapers in the eastern u.s. the company said
looking ahead to the fourth quarter the outlook for the newspaper group remains <unk> with no improvement yet seen in operating trends in our eastern markets said robert f. <unk> times <unk> 's chairman and chief executive
copper futures sold off sharply yesterday <unk> by declines in the stock market and dollar and a rally in bonds
december copper opened near monday 's close tried to rally but failed and then triggered <unk> orders on its way down to settle at $ N a pound off N cents for the day
<unk> orders are placed previously with instructions to <unk> them if the market hits a <unk> price
william kaiser president of the kaiser financial group in chicago said the decline was almost certainly <unk> by the early sell-off in the stock market which partly reflected a weakening economy
he said the recent decline in copper stocks was misleading in the face of a slowdown in manufacturing
mr. kaiser said traders could have picked up <unk> of an <unk> price decline had they been watching the <unk> metal markets which became <unk> weaker two to three weeks ago
but though a weakening economy <unk> reduced demand mr. kaiser said that third world <unk> countries have n't any choice but to sell copper
they might even step up sales in a falling market he said in an effort to maintain the flow of foreign exchange into their <unk>
<unk> mr. kaiser noted that a lot of traders had bought into the market when the price was in the $ N to $ N range thinking there was support at the $ N level
when the market fell below that level on monday and then yesterday could n't climb above that level traders started selling out their positions
<unk> <unk> senior metals analyst at prudential-bache securities in new york agreed that most of the selling was of a technical nature
she said the market hit the $ N level at around N a.m. edt where it <unk> a large number of <unk> orders
more <unk> orders were <unk> off all the way down to below $ N where modest buying was attracted
ms. <unk> said the <unk> of <unk> in canada and mexico will have little effect on supplies of copper until early next year
she thinks the next area of support for copper is in the $ N to $ N range
i believe that as soon as the selling <unk> somewhat we could see a rally back to the $ N region she added
she thinks a recovery in the stock market would help copper rebound as well
she noted that the preliminary estimate of the third-quarter gross national product is due out tomorrow and is expected to be up about N N to N N
if the number is a little better then copper will respond <unk> if it is worse then more selling could <unk> she predicted
ms. <unk> noted that relating economic numbers to specific market activity is <unk>
yesterday for example the durable goods numbers came out for september and the number was down only N N she said
however if you exclude <unk> orders then durable goods were down N N
i believe that number reflects a slowing economy
she said copper traders will also be looking toward the release of the index of leading economic <unk> next tuesday
however david <unk> president of <unk> & co. an international metals company noted that so far this year copper consumption is way ahead of the same period of N and that projected production is below last year
mr. <unk> said the copper market seems to be <unk> a recession in three months with declining use being the result
but he added we have had that <unk> same <unk> six times in the last six years
he noted that currently the ratio of available copper to consumption is about N weeks
he said the normal ratio is five to six weeks
according to mr. <unk> the <unk> in copper production is n't at the mines but at the copper <unk>
it takes three months to turn copper concentrate into <unk> he said
if there is n't a recession he said we will be out of copper by the end of march
if there is a recession that will change the <unk> situation
he thinks that without a recession copper prices could exceed a high of $ N a pound which was reached last year
in the past mr. <unk> has been known to have substantial long positions that is he had bought copper futures in anticipation of rising prices in the copper futures market
in other commodity markets yesterday
energy the attitude was <unk> in crude oil futures yesterday in trading on the new york mercantile exchange
prices for the u.s. benchmark west texas <unk> crude remained <unk> in a fairly narrow range before ending the session four cents lower at $ N a barrel for december delivery

but an early <unk> drop in the dow jones industrial average stopped the crude rally cold
the industrial average recovered to close only N points lower but petroleum futures never shook off the <unk>
most market participants said they were looking to this week 's <unk> statistics from the american petroleum institute to give the market some direction
the report is n't generally available until late on <unk>
precious metals futures prices <unk> upward in mostly lackluster trading
december gold was up $ N an ounce at $ N december silver gained N cents to $ N an ounce
january platinum rose $ N an ounce to $ N
mr. kaiser said there were no fundamental factors moving these markets
he noted that two weeks ago there were rumors of soviet sales of precious metals to finance grain purchases but the sales do n't seem to have <unk>
ms. <unk> thought yesterday 's price action reflected weakness in the stock market and the dollar
gold still acts as a haven when uncertainty <unk> in the financial markets as it did yesterday she said
mr. kaiser noted that gold was more than N times the price of silver at the close yesterday which is <unk> high
the high ratio reflects the fact that silver is still regarded as about a <unk> metal and its price <unk> relative to gold says that traders are expecting a weakening economy he said
<unk> and <unk> prices closed lower after trading in relatively narrow ranges because of strong selling in the cash market and continued favorable <unk> weather
the sale to the chinese government of N metric tons of <unk> under the government 's export <unk> program was announced after the close of trading monday but the sale was expected and failed to <unk> prices yesterday said <unk> <unk> a futures analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc. in chicago
as for other export customers the soviet union is n't expected to be back buying u.s. corn in significant amounts until early next year he said

cocoa futures at first continued the rally begun on monday but then <unk> and closed lower
the december contract opened just under monday 's close triggered some previously placed buy orders just above $ N a metric <unk> pushing the price to $ N and then <unk> heavy selling by traders who buy and sell for their own accounts and by commercial interests
the contract settled at $ N a <unk> off $ N
robert <unk> senior commodities analyst at kaiser financial group said monday 's rally continued yesterday for only about N minutes after the opening
he said even though there was arbitrage buying in new york because of the weak dollar cocoa fell to <unk> pressure from bearish traders
but he noted that speculators apparently do n't believe there is much more of a decline in store for cocoa
the december contract reached its <unk> low of $ N a <unk> on oct. N its <unk> high was $ N set in N and its recent high was $ N set in early august
the last time cocoa traded at prices as low as currently was in N
but while further modest declines might be ahead mr. <unk> said it would be difficult to get through resistance levels just above yesterday 's high

next to <unk> <unk> roberts 's <unk> rjr nabisco deal sci television is small <unk>
but the troubles of sci tv are a classic <unk> of the leveraged buy-out <unk> of the 1980s especially the <unk> game
sci tv which expects to release a plan to restructure $ N billion of debt in the next day or so is n't just another lbo that went bad after <unk> on debt though it did do that
the cable and tv station company was an lbo of an lbo a set of assets that were leveraged twice <unk> the blue-chip buy-out king henry <unk> in N to take more than $ N billion of cash out of the <unk> <unk>
sci tv 's buy-out was an <unk> in the <unk> for mr. <unk> and for investors in kkr partnerships
but it has left holders of sci tv 's junk bonds holding the <unk> including some <unk> that kkr might need to finance future deals such as <unk> financial services first executive columbia savings & loan and prudential insurance co. of america
some <unk> are said to be considering legal action against kkr or moves to force sci tv into bankruptcy court
and kkr 's majority partner in sci tv 's buy-out <unk> <unk> entrepreneur george gillett also is said to be very <unk>
sci tv 's six stations once were part of <unk> communications
kkr <unk> up the cable and television company with debt in an N buy-out then later sold <unk> 's cable operations at a fat profit
in N kkr for the second time <unk> debt onto <unk> 's tv stations selling them for $ N billion to a new <unk> that was <unk> by kkr and <unk> by gillett corp. which now operates the sci tv stations
in this second lbo kkr with one hand took more than $ N billion of cash out of the tv company 's assets and moved it into the <unk> cable operations making them more valuable in a N sale
<unk> also took $ N million of <unk> sci tv bonds as partial payment for the tv assets
with the other hand kkr put back into sci tv less than N N of the cash it had taken out buying sci tv common and preferred shares
so while kkr today has an estimated $ N million <unk> in <unk> sci tv including equity and debt the lbo firm still is $ N billion ahead on the sci tv buy-out after taking cash up front
on <unk> as a whole kkr <unk> up <unk> annual returns of N N in the three years it owned <unk>
meanwhile mr. gillett risks losing his entire equity investment of about $ N million in sci tv if the company ca n't be <unk>
overall mr. gillett 's holding company gillett holdings is heavily <unk> and except for its <unk> mountain resorts is n't doing very well
with the tv business falling on hard times in recent years analysts say that if sci tv had to be <unk> today it might <unk> N N less than in the N buy-out <unk> out most of the company 's <unk> and its stockholders
meanwhile sci tv can barely pay its cash interest bill and to stay out of bankruptcy court it must soon <unk> a lot of bank loans and junk bonds that have fallen due
sci tv 's <unk> period for paying its bills is due to expire nov. N
it now is <unk> <unk> among creditors a preliminary plan to restructure debt
negotiations have started <unk> <unk> but that 's not to say we like this particular offer says <unk> ross of <unk> inc. adviser to sci tv <unk>
no major player in the sci tv deal will talk publicly
but it 's understood that mr. <unk> is <unk> that mr. gillett did n't manage to boost sci tv 's operating profit after the buy-out
mr. <unk> apparently thinks sci tv can <unk> if lenders extend its debt payments until tv stations rise in value again allowing sci tv to sell assets to pay debt
mr. gillett is said to be <unk> of his operating record he has <unk> some stations ' ratings and turned around a <unk> station
as for <unk> they 're <unk> it can be a <unk> to take the other side of a trade by kkr
the bonds of sci tv now are being quoted at prices ranging from only five cents to about N cents on the dollar according to <unk> smith & co. in new york which trades <unk> securities
people who have seen sci tv 's restructuring plan say it offers concessions by kkr and gillett corp
they would both give part of their combined $ N million in common equity in sci tv to holders of sci tv 's $ N million of junk bonds as a <unk> to persuade them to accept new bonds that might reduce the value of their claims on the company
but some <unk> sci tv <unk> say that 's not enough
they contend that sci tv 's equity now is <unk>
they add that it is n't <unk> kkr anything to give up equity because of its big <unk> cash profit on the buy-out which they think contributed to sci tv 's current problems
<unk> the biggest holder of senior sci tv bonds has refused to join the <unk> committee and is said to be reviewing its legal options
to protect their claims some <unk> want kkr and perhaps mr. gillett to invest new money in sci tv perhaps $ N million or more
one investment banker who is n't involved in the deal says sci tv needs at least $ N million of new equity to <unk>
<unk> say they have a stick to beat kkr with the threat of bankruptcy is a legitimate <unk> to <unk> money from kkr says one big sci tv holder
this could be the first major bankruptcy-law <unk> for kkr he adds
a big <unk> case might <unk> kkr 's name and provide new fuel for critics of <unk> in washington and elsewhere
but others say <unk> have nothing to gain by putting sci tv into bankruptcy-law proceedings
while kkr does n't control sci tv which is unusual for a kkr investment it clearly has much <unk> <unk> than mr. gillett
bankruptcy specialists say mr. <unk> set a <unk> for putting new money in <unk> <unk> recently when kkr <unk> <unk> <unk> furniture doubling kkr 's equity stake
but with <unk> kkr was only trying to <unk> its original investment says bankruptcy investor james <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> in new york
by contrast kkr probably has already made all the money it can on sci tv
and people who know mr. <unk> say he is n't in a <unk> to <unk> more money into sci tv

a # N million $ N million british airways plc rights issue <unk> badly the <unk> of recent market <unk> and the collapse of the buy-out bid for united airlines ' parent ual corp
the united <unk> carrier had planned the issue to help finance its $ N million purchase of a N N stake in ual
but british airways withdrew from the ual labor-management buy-out plan last friday after the group failed to get bank financing for its $ N billion buy-out
british airways said its shareholders accepted only N N of the convertible capital bonds but that the rest of the issue will be taken up by underwriters
analysts said that N N level marked the <unk> showing for any major british rights issue since the N global stock market crash
it is close to being a record <unk> said bob <unk> an analyst with london broker smith new court securities
fund managers do n't like to have rights issues that do n't have an obvious reason
the obvious reason was for british air to buy a stake in united airlines
in a statement british air chairman <unk> king said the company was obviously <unk> that the issue was not taken up but it would have been <unk> to expect a better result given the volatility of the stock market since the launch of the issue
but except for the <unk> british air will emerge relatively <unk> from the <unk> issue
underwriters led by <unk> brothers & co. will pick up the rest of the airline 's offer of four convertible capital bonds for every nine common shares
<unk> and other primary underwriters have reduced or eliminated their exposure by <unk> the issue among u.k. institutional investors
the paper loss here is very small for these <unk> <unk> john nelson a <unk> managing director
in any case he added most institutions probably wo n't sell the bonds
and instead of buying the ual stake the u.k. carrier will be able to reduce its high debt level and build an acquisition war <unk>
from a cash flow point of view british airways is better off not being in united airlines in the short term said <unk> <unk> an analyst at nomura research institute in london
added another u.k. analyst it gives them some cash in the back <unk> for when they want to do something

the airline 's share price already is far below the N pence $ N level seen after the company announced the rights issue in late september
in late trading on london 's stock exchange yesterday the shares were off three pence at N pence
and because british air is <unk> convertible bonds rather than <unk> shares the share price wo n't be directly hurt by any surplus left with underwriters after they try to sell the issue in the open market
but british air 's withdrawal from the ual buy-out could have further <unk>
some analysts <unk> yesterday that the move has set off a board room split which may lead to the resignation of sir <unk> marshall the carrier 's chief executive officer

in an oct. N <unk> article it 's the world bank 's turn to <unk> paul craig roberts <unk> most of the blame for what <unk> developing countries at the <unk> of the world bank
the article is unfortunately <unk> with <unk> <unk>
one of mr. roberts 's <unk> is that the bank 's own loan portfolio is in deep trouble because of its lending to developing countries
this is just not so
the reality is that bank <unk> are rock solid
as of june N N the day our past fiscal year came to a close only N N of the bank 's portfolio was affected by <unk> of over six months
this is an <unk> low level
moreover the bank follows a <unk> <unk> policy and has set aside $ N million against possible loan losses
for the same fiscal year by the way the bank 's net income was a robust $ N billion after provisions
because of the <unk> <unk> in which the bank goes about development financial markets have confidence in it
this helps explain the triple-a rating <unk> by our bonds and our ability to <unk> $ N billion in fiscal N on the most <unk> terms
another of mr. roberts 's <unk> is that bank lending has done more <unk> than good by <unk> the wrong incentives and <unk> energy away from economic development
here too mr. roberts is way off the mark
the reality is that bank loans have been linked to policy improvements for N years
our traditional project loans have for instance supported <unk> energy pricing in the power sector sound interest-rate policies in the credit area and the operation of public utilities as efficient <unk> agencies
by and large these efforts have <unk> fruit
in my home region latin america much of the existing <unk> base an important building block for development has been financed by the world bank
mr. roberts also takes a <unk> at the bank 's adjustment lending
what are the facts on this type of lending
the bank has been making adjustment loans for N years
as their name <unk> these operations are linked to <unk> policy reforms that aim at helping borrowing countries get back on the growth path and at <unk> their <unk>
typically these measures include reforms to <unk> the role of government and <unk> in the economy to open up <unk> <unk> to international competition and to promote the development of a <unk> private sector
support for the private sector has been a <unk> concern of the bank 's
over the years it has helped encourage investments by entrepreneurs in the third world through its extensive credit operations and through loans and investments by the international finance corp
most recently the bank group has been expanded to include the <unk> investment guarantee agency to <unk> direct foreign investment in developing countries by offering guarantees against <unk> risk and advice to member countries on how to improve their business climate
these are not the actions of a development agency <unk> to central planning and to the <unk> of investment decisions in the hands of government as mr. roberts alleges
rather they reflect the bank 's <unk> <unk> approach which <unk> at <unk> that developing countries put their <unk> resources to the best possible use

much like their <unk> in political consulting and product marketing the litigation advisers encourage their clients to play down complex or <unk> matters <unk> their <unk> and provide their target <unk> with a <unk> <unk> to make the <unk> choice
with jury <unk> getting bigger all the time companies are increasingly willing to pay huge <unk> for such advice
recently litigation sciences helped <unk> co. win a $ N billion jury <unk> against texaco inc

in any <unk> case you can be sure that one side or the other or even both is using litigation consultants

in the film classic <unk> angry men the <unk> of <unk> <unk> each <unk> 's bias and <unk> it from playing a role in the <unk>
after hours of conflict and debate that jury <unk> on the facts with <unk> <unk>

litigation consulting is as new york trial attorney donald <unk> puts it highly <unk>
he adds the notion they try to sell is that <unk> do n't make decisions <unk>
but the effort is also being made to try and cause jurors not to decide things <unk>
i find it <unk>
but mr. <unk> also acknowledges that consultants can be very effective
it 's gotten to the point where if the case is large enough it 's almost <unk> not to use them he says
others <unk> that the consultants ' growing influence <unk> the advantage of <unk> <unk> enough to afford such <unk> services
the <unk> people and the corporations can buy it the poor <unk> in political cases get it free and everybody in between is at a <unk> and that 's not the kind of system we want says <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> who <unk> at george washington university
sophisticated trial consulting grew <unk> from the radical political movements of the <unk> and 1970s before finding its more <unk> calling in big commercial cases
the <unk> N trial in N in which daniel <unk> and others were charged with <unk> <unk> <unk> was a <unk>
in that case a group of <unk> <unk> interviewed N registered voters around <unk>
the researchers discovered that <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> were nearly always against the defendants the lawyers resolved to try to keep them off the jury
the defense also learned that <unk> people were <unk> conservative about the vietnam war
a more <unk> panel became a second aim
ultimately that carefully picked jury <unk> with a N vote to <unk> and the <unk> decided not to <unk> the case
litigation consulting had arrived
the <unk> science went corporate in N when international business machines corp. hired a marketing professor to help defend a complex antitrust case
the problem for ibm trial lawyers thomas <unk> and david <unk> was how to make such a highly technical case <unk>
as the trial <unk> they were eager to know if the jury was keeping up with them
the solution <unk> by the professor was to hire six people who would <unk> the actual jury <unk> sit in on the trial and report their <unk> to him
he then <unk> messrs. <unk> and <unk> who had the chance to <unk> their next day 's <unk> <unk>
thus the shadow jury was born
mr. <unk> the professor got the law <unk> and formed litigation sciences
ibm won the case
the <unk> thing in any complex case is to retain <unk> and in some sense your <unk> says mr. <unk> of <unk> <unk> & <unk>
what you look for in a shadow jury is very much what you do when you give an opening argument to your wife or a friend and get some response to it
a shadow jury is a way to do that in a more <unk> and organized way
the approach worked well in the recent antitrust case in which energy transportation systems inc. sued santa fe pacific corp. over the transport of <unk> coal the kind of case likely to make almost anyone 's eyes <unk> over
energy transportation retained litigation sciences at a cost of several hundred thousand dollars to poll <unk> <unk> and shadow
just before the actual closing <unk> the firm put the case to a vote of the five shadow jurors each of whom was being paid $ N a day
the jurors who did n't know which side had retained them decided for energy transportation and awarded $ N million in damages
the real jury returned days later with a $ N million victory for energy transportation
it 's just like weather <unk> says energy transportation trial attorney harry <unk> of <unk> & <unk>
it 's often wrong but it 's better than consulting an indian <unk> <unk>
<unk> is only one part of litigation sciences ' work
changing the outcome of the trial is what really matters
and to the <unk> some of the firm 's approaches may seem <unk> <unk>
<unk> jurors are supposed to <unk> the evidence in a case <unk> and <unk>
instead mr. <unk> says <unk> with thousands of jurors <unk> that they start with <unk> <unk> <unk> and try to <unk> the facts of the case to fit their views
<unk> <unk> helps the consultants develop a <unk> of the right type of <unk>
if it is a case in which the client seeks <unk> damages for example depressed <unk> people are far more likely to grant them
someone with a <unk> 's degree in <unk> <unk> who works in a <unk> would be <unk> litigation sciences <unk>
so would someone recently <unk> or <unk>
since litigation sciences generally represents the defense its job is usually to help the lawyers identify and remove such people from the jury
for <unk> cases litigation sciences seeks defense jurors who believe that most people including victims get what they <unk>
such people also typically hold negative <unk> toward the <unk> <unk> the poor blacks and women
the consultants help the defense lawyers find such jurors by asking questions about potential jurors ' <unk> toward <unk> work or toward particular movies or books
litigation sciences does n't make <unk> <unk>
if a client needs <unk> jurors the firm will help find them
as mr. <unk> <unk> it we do n't control the facts
they are what they are
but any lawyer will select the facts and the strategy to <unk>
in our system of <unk> the trial lawyer is duty <unk> to present the best case he possibly can
once a jury is selected the consultants often continue to determine what the jurors ' <unk> are likely to be and help shape the lawyers ' <unk> <unk>
<unk> plays a minimal role here
more important are what <unk> calls <unk> <unk> a few <unk> points calculated to appeal to the jury on a <unk> level
in one <unk> case a woman claimed she had been injured when she slipped in a pool but the fall did n't explain why one of her arms was <unk> <unk>
by <unk> <unk> the jury 's attention to the arm the defense lawyers <unk> doubt about the <unk> of the woman 's injuries
the <unk> worked
the defense won
in a classic defense of a <unk> case the consultants concentrate on encouraging the jury to shift the blame
the <unk> defense in a case involving an accident is to persuade the jurors to hold the accident <unk> responsible for his or her <unk> mr. <unk> has written
<unk> graphics <unk> for <unk> also play a major role in litigation sciences ' operation
studies show the consultants say that people absorb information better and remember it longer if they receive it <unk>
<unk> <unk> help
the average american <unk> seven hours of tv a day
they are very <unk> sophisticated <unk> <unk> graphics specialist robert <unk>
lawyers remain divided about whether anything is wrong with all this
supporters <unk> that the process <unk> to <unk> but they insist that the best trial lawyers have always <unk> similar <unk>
they may not have been able to <unk> it all but they did it says stephen <unk> a legal ethics expert at new york university law school
what you have here is <unk> made <unk>
many lawyers maintain that all 's fair in the <unk> system as long as no one <unk> with the evidence
others point out that lawyers in small <unk> have always had a feel for public sentiment and used that to advantage
litigation consulting is n't a guarantee of a favorable outcome
litigation sciences concedes that in one in N cases it was <unk> wrong in its <unk>
a few attorneys offer <unk> stories of jobs <unk> by consultants or of <unk> services as when one lawyer paid a consultant not at litigation sciences $ N to interview a jury after a big trial and later read more <unk> <unk> with the same jurors in the american lawyer magazine
some <unk> <unk> at the notion that a <unk> knows more than they do about what makes a jury <unk>
the <unk> of being a trial lawyer is <unk> how people of <unk> <unk> <unk> to you and your <unk> says <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> & <unk> who recently won a huge case on behalf of insurers against shell oil co
he says he used consultants in the case but found them to be virtually <unk>
but most lawyers accept that the <unk> has <unk>
and the question remains whether the jury system can maintain its <unk> while <unk> such a <unk> <unk>
for more than a decade mr. <unk> the <unk> has been a leading <unk> of the <unk>
there 's no reason to believe that <unk> rule <unk> he says
but the last thing you want to do is <unk> the <unk> to make them think better
what you then do is you make them think <unk>
to <unk> the work of litigation scientists he suggests that courts sharply limit the number of jurors that lawyers can remove from the jury panel through so-called <unk> challenges <unk> that do n't require <unk>
in most civil cases judges allow each side three such challenges
for complex cases judges sometimes allow many more
mr. <unk> also suggests <unk> anyone from <unk> <unk> information about the jurors
some courts release names and <unk> and researchers can drive by houses look up credit ratings and even question <unk>
<unk> he says <unk> should not be allowed to <unk> jurors ' <unk>
even some lawyers who have used consultants to their advantage see a need to limit their impact
mr. <unk> the first lawyer to use mr. <unk> 's services <unk> against courts ' allowing extensive jury <unk> known as <unk> <unk> or giving out personal information about the jurors
the more extensive the <unk> <unk> the easier you make it for that kind of research to be effective and i do n't think courts should lend themselves to that mr. <unk> says
silicon graphics inc. a <unk> maker of computer <unk> said it <unk> two federal government contracts worth more than $ N million over the next five years
one award is part of a department of defense contract to loral <unk> <unk> computers and could be valued at more than $ N million over five years
the other <unk> the sale of about N of the company 's <unk> <unk> to the national <unk> of health
the models which cost about $ N each will be used in research
the <unk> are evidence that silicon graphics ' approach to computer graphics is <unk> on with users of powerful desktop computers analysts said
the company 's on a roll said robert <unk> an analyst at <unk> & <unk>
no other computer <unk> offers graphics performance that good for their price
in the battle to supply desktop computers for researchers and design engineers most of the attention is given to the biggest competitors sun <unk> inc. hewlett-packard co. and digital equipment corp. which make computers mainly aimed at a wide range of engineering and scientific needs
silicon graphics on the other hand has <unk> a specific <unk> since its <unk> in N which has been dubbed by some as <unk> computing
this is a style of <unk> computing that provides <unk> color models of everything from the inside of a house to the latest in women 's fashion
though silicon graphics is much smaller than digital <unk> and sun it has emerged in recent years as a <unk> <unk> in this graphics portion of the <unk> market
in addition the company has made it tough on competitors by offering a <unk> of desktop computers at sharply lower prices
a year ago silicon graphics introduced a model priced at $ N almost as cheap as <unk> <unk> that do n't offer special graphics features
silicon graphics also plans to <unk> even less expensive machines in the near future
it 's pretty safe to assume we can bring the cost down of these systems by N N to N N a year said edward <unk> the company 's chief executive officer
silicon graphics ' strategy seems to be paying off
revenue for its first quarter ended sept. N was $ N million a N N increase over the year-ago period
profit was $ N million compared with $ N million for the year-ago quarter
remember those <unk> <unk> <unk> of N years ago
they or at least something less efficient than today 's <unk> units may soon be making a comeback
that something whatever it is could add as much as $ N to the $ N or so consumers now pay for <unk> <unk>
these and other expensive changes in products ranging from auto air <unk> to <unk> <unk> to commercial <unk> are in prospect because of something called the <unk> <unk> signed by N nations in N
in one of the most <unk> environmental regulatory efforts to date involving products with an annual value of $ N billion in the u.s. alone the <unk> agreed to <unk> sharply the use of <unk> cfcs
world-wide production would be cut in half by N
the u.s. senate <unk> the treaty so well it <unk> it by a vote of N to N
not to be <unk> george bush wants cfcs <unk> <unk> by the year N a goal <unk> at an <unk> <unk> environmental meeting in <unk> in the spring
that 's a lot of <unk> as it turns out
cfcs are the primary <unk> in a gas often <unk> to by the <unk> <unk> trade name <unk> which is <unk> to liquid form to serve as the <unk> agent in <unk> and <unk> equipment
<unk> <unk> cfcs are <unk> into <unk> to make the <unk> used in <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a highly efficient <unk> which accounts for why the walls of <unk> and <unk> can be <unk> now than they were back in the days when they were <unk> with glass <unk>
but even though by some estimates it might cost the world as much as $ N billion between now and the year N to convert to other <unk> <unk> agents and <unk> and to <unk> equipment for these less efficient <unk> the <unk> <unk> 's <unk> of supporters say it is worth it
they insist that cfcs are <unk> the earth 's <unk> ozone <unk> which screens out some of the sun 's <unk> <unk>
<unk> as they see it if something is n't done <unk> will become ever more subject to <unk> and <unk> cancer
peter <unk> a specialist in heat transfer is running a project at arthur d. little inc. of <unk> mass. to find alternative technologies that will allow industry to eliminate cfcs
in addition to his interest in ozone <unk> he has <unk> <unk> the related topic of global warming a theory that <unk> 's generation of <unk> <unk> through increased <unk> of <unk> <unk> is creating a <unk> effect that will work important <unk> changes in the earth 's atmosphere over time
i would be the first to <unk> that there is not a complete consensus in the scientific community on either one of these problems says mr. <unk>
in the kind of <unk> i read i come across <unk> <unk> quite frequently
but the nature of the problem is such that many others feel it has to be <unk> soon before all the evidence is in
we ca n't afford to wait
but does it have to be so soon
some <unk> scientists think that even if cfcs were released into the atmosphere at an <unk> rate the amount of ozone <unk> would be only N N by the middle of the next century
it 's easy to get something comparable by simply moving to a higher <unk> in the u.s.
moreover there are questions particularly among <unk> scientists who know this subject best about the ability of anyone to know what in fact is happening to the ozone <unk>
it is generally agreed that when cfcs rise from earth to <unk> the <unk> in them is <unk> of <unk> with the process through which <unk> <unk> split <unk> <unk> and form ozone
but ozone <unk> is a very <unk> natural process and the importance of <unk> cfcs in reducing it is largely a matter of <unk>
the ozone <unk> is <unk> in motion and thus very hard to measure
what scientists have known since the late 1970s is that there is a <unk> in the <unk> over <unk> that <unk> or contracts from year to year
but it is at least <unk> of some note that there are very few <unk> in <unk>
moreover <unk> someone has noticed that household <unk> are closed systems running for many years without either the <unk> gas or the <unk> ever <unk>
another argument of the environmentalists is that if <unk> are available why not use them
mr. <unk> <unk> a list of <unk> but none so far match the <unk> <unk> cfcs
<unk> and <unk> can be used as <unk> for example but are <unk>
moreover new <unk> will be needed to protect <unk> from the new <unk> which as with cfcs are <unk>
mr. <unk> points out as well that if the equipment designed to get along without cfcs is less efficient than current devices energy consumption will rise and that will <unk> the <unk> effect
<unk> in the <unk> who just suffered a mid-october <unk> may wonder where the <unk> was when they needed it but let 's not be <unk> about <unk> risks
as it <unk> arthur d. little is not at all interested in <unk> cold water on ozone <unk> and global warming <unk>
it is interested in making some money advising industry on how to convert to a world without cfcs
there is after all big money in <unk>
maybe we should ask why it was that <unk> <unk> so quickly <unk> and issued a statement giving it wide publicity that it was <unk> cfcs
<unk> introduced in N <unk> america by making <unk> and air <unk> practical after all
one answer is that big companies are growing <unk> of fighting environmental movements and are trying instead to cash in on them although they never care to put it quite that way
<unk> <unk> as it <unk> has a potential <unk> for cfcs
imperial chemical industries of the u.k. also has one and is building a plant in <unk> to produce it
japanese chemical companies are at work developing their own <unk> and hoping to <unk> new markets of course
there are still others who do n't mind seeing new <unk> <unk>
environmental groups would soon go out of business were they not able to send out <unk> <unk> the latest threat and asking for money to fight it
university <unk> and consultants with scientific <unk> saw a huge market for their services <unk> when price <unk> <unk> the energy crisis and thus the demand for alternative energy
they needed new <unk> to generate new grants and contracts
in other words <unk> has created a whole set of <unk> interests that fare better when there are many problems than when there are few
that <unk> to <unk> the public debate toward solutions even when some of the most <unk> scientists are skeptical about the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of <unk>
there is an <unk> of <unk> involved
consumers pay the bill for all this in the price of a <unk> or an <unk> car
if they were really getting insurance against environmental disaster the price would be cheap
but if there is no <unk> threat it can get to be very expensive

<unk> kasparov went to <unk> sunday with the world 's most advanced <unk> computer and <unk> it around <unk> anyway like an old <unk> can
playing black in the first game the human champion <unk> deep thought known for its <unk> <unk> into a totally passive position
then he <unk> his own <unk> attack
and in the second game with mr. kasparov <unk> <unk> as white d.t. offered <unk> resistance and lost even faster
well <unk> can rest easier for now
though almost everybody at the playing site had been looking for the <unk> soviet to beat the <unk> computer he gave the machine a far worse <unk> than many expected
and when mr. kasparov <unk> into the playing hall he called the outcome
as if he were <unk> <unk> about to enter the <unk> with a <unk> <unk> he declared i 'll be able to beat any computer for the next five years
his strategy against d.t. was based on a <unk> study of <unk> of its games he said including its <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and robert <unk> of the u.s.
mr. kasparov was <unk>
the computer 's mind is too straight too <unk> <unk> the <unk> and <unk> needed to reach the top he said
the champion apparently was not worried at all about d.t. 's strong points
its chief <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> his <unk> the <unk> for its <unk> <unk> at <unk> out of <unk> positions
d.t. also has a <unk> and <unk> memory is <unk> <unk> and could n't be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> <unk> spread around the playing hall in the new york academy of art
in fact d.t. never left home <unk> <unk> university in pittsburgh but <unk> with its human <unk> by telephone link
they conceded that the odds <unk> mr. kasparov but they put their hope in d.t. 's recently enhanced capacity for <unk> positions up to a million per second from N
but the <unk> <unk> stuck with silicon chips they needed <unk>
this became apparent as game one a <unk> defense by mr. kasparov <unk>
no human can <unk> millions of moves but mr. kasparov using his <unk> powerful <unk> consistently found very good ones
after eight moves by each side the board was the same as in a game in which <unk> short of great britain <unk> the champion to a draw in N
but the computer did n't play mr. short 's <unk> move a key <unk> <unk> and its position <unk> rapidly
instead of <unk> a standard measure to <unk> the king d.t. made a <unk> <unk> <unk> at move N then it put a knight <unk> on move N
only two classes of <unk> would think of this very weak human players and computers said <unk> <unk> the expert <unk> for the match which was <unk> by hundreds of <unk> fans
by move N d.t. had fallen into a deep <unk> <unk>
it allowed mr. kasparov to exchange his <unk> <unk> for one of d.t. 's <unk>
<unk> usually are worth slightly more than <unk> but in this case mr. kasparov was left with a very dangerous knight and d.t. 's <unk> <unk> was reduced to <unk>
indeed it looked more like a <unk> a <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> put it
consistently d.t. was <unk> about its <unk> which it <unk> <unk> up in <unk> form
when most <unk> thought its position <unk> the computer thought it was only in effect <unk> of a <unk> down
such <unk> met with <unk> and kept the machine from <unk> as soon as <unk> would have <unk> more <unk>
while d.t. <unk> its king back and <unk> in a defensive <unk> mr. kasparov <unk> the knight to a dominant <unk>
he also launched a <unk> storm <unk> a <unk> to <unk> d.t. 's king
no amount of <unk> could have <unk> this game for <unk>
a piece down the computer resigned
now with the crowd in the analysis room <unk> <unk> blood the only question seemed to be how fast mr. kasparov could win game two
with the advantage of playing white which moves first mr. kasparov followed up <unk> against the computer 's defense a <unk> 's <unk> accepted
as early as move six mr. kasparov <unk> from a well-known <unk> of moves developing a knight instead of making a standard <unk> attack against the computer 's advanced knight
this left the computer with a broader range of <unk> <unk> and it immediately <unk> by moving a <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> development
in a new position just after the opening a computer will have serious problems mr. kasparov said later
in such positions he explained you have to create something new and the computer is n't able to do that right now
after only N moves for each side the computer 's position was <unk>
<unk> it <unk> a <unk> at the cost of facing a <unk> attack
and when a defensive move was called for d.t. passed up an obvious <unk> move and instead <unk> its <unk> to immediate <unk> <unk>
mr. kasparov <unk> later that even a weak club player would have avoided the <unk> move
now after only a dozen moves <unk> were looking for a <unk> combination
on a <unk> board <unk> <unk> <unk> showed a quick kill <unk> by a knight <unk> no <unk> <unk> this line of play
mr. kasparov 's <unk> was slower but in the end just as <unk>
he won d.t. 's <unk> for two minor pieces and two <unk> not enough compensation in this position to give the computer much hope
in a <unk> position the computer resigned rather than make its <unk> move
and mr. kasparov to <unk> and <unk> <unk> back into the analysis room
in both games i got exactly what i wanted he said
what he had <unk> he added is that there 's more to <unk> than <unk> <unk>

mr. <unk> is a reporter in the journal 's new york bureau
<unk> for that extra bit of yield can be a big <unk> especially if you do n't understand what you 're investing in
just ask richard blumenfeld a new jersey <unk> who <unk> himself a <unk> sophisticated investor
in may N dr. blumenfeld gave merrill lynch & co. about $ N for a federally insured <unk> of deposit offering an effective yield of more than N N
it was a time when interest rates came down very rapidly dr. blumenfeld recalls
yields on five-year cds at major banks were <unk> about N N and 10-year treasury notes were paying less than N N
the cd seemed like a great deal
but nearly N N years later merrill says the investment is worth about $ N an amount that represents an annual return of just over N N on dr. blumenfeld 's $ N
the problem is that the cd he bought for a retirement plan was n't a <unk> <unk> cd
instead his merrill broker put him in a zero-coupon cd which is sold at a deep discount to its face value
the difference between the price and the face value payable at maturity is the investor 's return
more important the cd was purchased on the secondary or <unk> market
because the cd had an effective yield of N N when it was issued in N and interest rates in general had declined sharply since then part of the price dr. blumenfeld paid was a premium an additional amount on top of the cd 's base value plus <unk> interest that represented the cd 's increased market value
now the thrift that issued the cd is insolvent and dr. blumenfeld has learned to his surprise that the premium is n't insured under federal deposit insurance
the <unk> came when he opened a recent merrill lynch statement and found that the cd 's estimated current market value had plummeted by $ N in a month
several phone calls and a visit to his broker 's office later the <unk> found out that the $ N drop represented the current value of the premium he paid when he bought the cd and that the amount was n't insured
this is one thing i was never aware of he says
he assumed that principal and interest were fully insured up to $ N he adds
dr. blumenfeld is n't <unk>
especially at times like these when declining rates make it hard for investors to get yields they have come to expect too many people chase the promise of <unk> returns without fully <unk> the risk
yield <unk> often gets in the way of <unk> things says john <unk> research director of the american association of individual investors a chicago-based educational group
the biggest problem we have is that investors realize after the fact that they did n't understand what they were investing in
dr. blumenfeld concedes he did n't fully understand what he was buying
he says that he knew he was getting a zero-coupon cd and that he had previously invested in <unk> treasury income growth receipts a type of zero-coupon treasury security sold by merrill lynch
but he says he did n't understand he was buying the cd on the secondary market and he contends his broker never fully explained the risks
the broker thomas <unk> of merrill lynch 's <unk> n.j. office <unk> to discuss the matter with a reporter referring inquiries to merrill lynch officials in new york
those officials say there was full disclosure of the risks in a fact sheet sent to all cd investors with their <unk> of sale
the fact sheet <unk> april N says on page three if the price paid for a cd purchased in the secondary market is higher than the <unk> value in the case of zero-coupon cds the difference is not insured
<unk> involving zero-coupon cds are more complicated and you should discuss any questions you may have with your financial consultant
dr. blumenfeld says he does n't remember the <unk> about premiums in the fact sheet he received and did n't realize part of what he paid was a premium
i assumed i was buying a cd as a cd he says
nevertheless merrill lynch has agreed that if the thrift that issued dr. blumenfeld 's cd <unk> <unk> federal savings & loan association in <unk> <unk> is <unk> and the cd <unk> the brokerage firm would cover the premium dr. blumenfeld paid
federal deposit insurance would pay principal and interest <unk> to the date of <unk> to a maximum of $ N
it 's not a <unk> commitment it 's a <unk> situation says albert <unk> a managing director of merrill lynch money markets inc
there 's a question whether brokers at the time were fully aware of the risks
we were n't sure that full disclosure as we wanted it was being made
merrill lynch says it 's impossible to estimate how many investors are in dr. blumenfeld 's situation although it says the firm has received only one other complaint about premiums on the secondary market in three years
merrill lynch now provides credit rating information about the institutions whose cds it sells which it did n't provide in N
zero-coupon cds are only a small portion of the $ N <unk> in cds outstanding and those purchased on the secondary market are an even smaller part of the total
merrill lynch estimates that fewer than N financial institutions currently issue zero-coupon cds
still there are several billion dollars of zero-coupon cds with various <unk> outstanding
because of the tax consequences of zero-coupon investments income tax is payable in the year interest is <unk> although interest is n't actually paid until maturity zero-coupon cds are usually sold for <unk> accounts to finance things like retirement and children 's education
most zero-coupon cds are in <unk> of six to nine years and they usually double in value by maturity
but investors who bought zero-coupon cds in the secondary market are n't the only ones who may be surprised to learn the full amount of their investments is n't insured
people who paid a premium for standard cds purchased on the secondary market could also find that those premiums are n't insured if the institutions that issued the cds failed
however those premiums are usually far smaller than on zero-coupon cds and the <unk> pricing structure of a standard cd makes it more apparent when a premium is paid
whatever the case a merrill lynch spokesman <unk> investors should n't have to worry about the <unk> premium issue unless the bank or thrift that issued the cd is closed and its deposits paid off before maturity or transferred to another institution at a lower rate
dr. blumenfeld says he 's <unk> that his problem has been resolved
and he says he 's learned a <unk> you always have to watch out for <unk>
no one else will watch out for you

carnival <unk> lines inc. 's common stock was <unk> down yesterday amid concerns that a bankruptcy filing by a <unk> <unk> would delay delivery of three big <unk> ships
the <unk> company 's stock fell $ N yesterday to $ N a share in heavy american stock exchange composite trading
early yesterday carnival said in a company statement that it had been notified <unk> that <unk> <unk> industries the <unk> <unk> that is building its three new <unk> ships planned to file for bankruptcy
officials at carnival declined to comment
there is just a tremendous amount of uncertainty about what the effect if any of all this is said john p. <unk> an analyst at raymond james associates inc
i did n't even know that a company in a <unk> country could file for bankruptcy
carnival said the <unk> the first of the three $ N million ships that carnival has on order is scheduled to be delivered next month just in time for the winter tourist season in the <unk>
that ship which would carry about N passengers would expand the capacity of carnival 's existing <unk> fleet by N N
the second ship which is <unk> is scheduled to be delivered in fall N and the third in fall N
there 's a N N chance that the <unk> will be delivered close to schedule said <unk> <unk> an analyst at shearson lehman hutton inc
the others will probably be delivered as well but carnival will likely have to pay a higher price for them
she said the company could pay as much as N N more for the ships
if the ships are n't delivered however it will likely have an effect on the company 's earnings as soon as the N fiscal year which begins dec. N
analysts said those estimates which range from about $ N a share to $ N a share are based on <unk> being in operation in N
if the ship <unk> to <unk> those per-share earnings estimates could be <unk> N cents or more
analysts were n't willing to <unk> on how much money carnival might lose through deposits
normally a company pays a portion of the total cost of a ship as it reaches various <unk> of construction
carnival for example has already paid about $ N million of the total cost for <unk>
some analysts say this may give it the right to <unk> the ship if the situation warrants it

<unk> corp. had a N N drop in third-quarter profit mainly because of lower sales of truck parts its largest and most profitable single business
sales of <unk> and <unk> trucks continue to <unk> <unk> rates leading <unk> to expect fourth-quarter net income to fall below year-earlier levels said stephen r. <unk> vice chairman and chief financial and administrative officer
he declined to make a specific earnings estimate
third-quarter net was $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share a year ago
sales rose N N to $ N million from $ N million
the quarter net was below analyst expectations mainly because <unk> sales did n't rebound in september from the summer <unk> as they usually do said <unk> e. <unk> analyst with mcdonald & co
mr. <unk> who had been expecting quarter profit of about $ N a share says he is reducing his estimate for the year to the area of $ N a share from his previous estimate of $ N
<unk> <unk> of painewebber inc. who a couple of weeks ago reduced his N estimate to $ N a share because of the weakening truck market says he will make another cut to about $ N a share in light of the third-quarter report

<unk> said sales of truck <unk> <unk> and other parts fell N N to $ N million
sales of parts for cars and construction vehicles rose
<unk> does n't provide profit figures separately for each category but operating profit for vehicle parts as a group fell N N to $ N million on an about N N drop in sales to $ N million
mr. <unk> said <unk> operators appear to be cautious about buying new trucks until they see how the economy <unk>
the truck sales slowdown reflects the general slowing in sales of consumer goods he said and the latest reports show a slight improvement rather than any indication of a downward <unk>
operating profit from electrical and electronics controls <unk> 's other major business group fell N N to $ N million despite a N N increase in sales to $ N million
the company attributed the decline to weakness in the <unk> market in north america and in the european <unk> market

in poland 's rapid shift from socialism to an <unk> alternative environmental issues have become a cutting edge of broader movements to restructure the economy cut <unk> <unk> and <unk> local politics
initial steps were taken at poland 's first international environmental conference which i <unk> last month
the conference held in lower <unk> was <unk> by the environment ministry the <unk> brothers fund and the polish <unk> club and was <unk> by N <unk> from government and industry as well as <unk> <unk> <unk> japanese and americans
the conference was <unk> economic <unk> for environmental protection a significant <unk> from east bloc <unk> which <unk> only one economic <unk> central planning to direct industrial behavior
even more <unk> it <unk> on <unk> trading and similar market approaches to address pollution <unk> poland 's lack of <unk> markets
why did east bloc participants <unk> <unk> <unk> pollution approaches
the answer lies both in the <unk> environment of these countries and the perceived causes of that <unk>
like other east bloc countries poland <unk> environmental laws more <unk> in their <unk> than in their <unk>
according to a detailed report by <unk> <unk> of the university of minnesota 's <unk> <unk> institute N areas <unk> a third of poland 's population are regarded as <unk> <unk> due to <unk> violations of standards
<unk> are consistently exceeded at N N of <unk> <unk> <unk> sites and N N of those for <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> of poland 's <unk> have become highly <unk> N N of its southern <unk> are projected to die by century 's end
between N and N polish <unk> fit for human consumption dropped from N N to N N of all <unk> <unk> while those <unk> even for industry use nearly doubled
poland produces about N times more <unk> and five times more <unk> <unk> and solid waste per unit of gross national product than does western europe
its mortality rate for <unk> over N is about N N higher than west germany 's and N N higher in <unk> areas than the national average
since N average annual growth rates for most <unk> have <unk> the growth of gnp
conference participants saw these effects as <unk> directly from a <unk> <unk> of environmental resources which are not produced by labor b planned <unk> ' <unk> to control pollution where enterprises are <unk> and penalties are paid by the government and c the continuing <unk> <unk> on heavy industry for economic development producing a far <unk> and more <unk> use of energy and natural resources than in the west
they <unk> noted that environmental progress could not be secured without true ownership <unk> competition based on market factors and the risk of bankruptcy if a business makes the wrong decisions
the solutions they formally proposed included <unk> taxes <unk> and <unk> incentives <unk> <unk> <unk> pollution <unk> an <unk> bank to finance <unk> credits and <unk> <unk>
but their most fundamental <unk> was to separate industry from the state making it fully <unk> for pollution control
a revolution takes more than conference <unk>
indeed <unk> was <unk> <unk> by a <unk> told by <unk> at the conference the world must be coming to an end
the <unk> are talking peace
the <unk> are talking elections
and the <unk> are engaged in commerce
but the implications of such a shift to market approaches go well beyond the fact that poland is already working on nationwide <unk> trades to reduce <unk> pollution or that the soviets plan to introduce <unk> pollution <unk> in some <unk> next year
those implications include privatization
faced with a $ N billion foreign debt and <unk> inflation poland must <unk> industry and eliminate subsidies to <unk> its currency and qualify for international assistance
<unk> pollution control may <unk> some capital that would otherwise purchase state industries
but it could also <unk> <unk> by <unk> industrial <unk> breaking up state <unk> giving managers a stake in solutions and <unk> that <unk> is not <unk> for failure to address environmental effects
<unk> solutions
as <unk> noted <unk> capital means the costs of control must be <unk> through a broad <unk> of <unk> choices for individual firms
that means simple clear rules that secure the first large <unk> of reduction <unk> more complex issues such as risk
it also means use of <unk> pollution limits such as <unk> <unk> rather than <unk> limits such as <unk> fees
that 's because <unk> managers will likely respond better to <unk> than to price <unk>
creative financing
even <unk> environmental solutions will require billions of dollars
new types of financing must make funds available without <unk> poland 's <unk> reserves
<unk>
east bloc pollution data typically have been state <unk>
while polish data have been <unk> available since N it was no accident that participants urged the free flow of information
for once information <unk> public participation follows and <unk> becomes difficult to <unk>
global <unk>
one <unk> <unk> declared that america has had a free market in goods but a planned economy for environmental protection while poland represents the <unk>
his point it will be increasingly difficult for the u.s. to <unk> to <unk> measures if even the east bloc steps to a different <unk>
at the moment poland <unk> <unk> pittsburgh more than a modern industrial society with <unk> production <unk> environmental management and little <unk> <unk>
but the continuing pressures for <unk> economics suggest the conference 's vision was not all <unk>

why ca n't we <unk> our children to read write and <unk>
it 's not that we do n't know how to because we do
it 's that we do n't want to
and the reason we do n't want to is that effective education would require us to <unk> some <unk> <unk> <unk> about human nature in general and the human nature of young people in particular as well as to <unk> some <unk> <unk> interests
these <unk> so <unk> our educational <unk> our media our politicians and even our parents that it seems almost <unk> to challenge them
here is an example
if i were to ask a <unk> of american parents do you wish the <unk> schools to encourage <unk> in your children the <unk> answer would be yes of course
but what do we mean specifically by <unk>
no one can say
in practice it ends up being <unk> with a <unk> that <unk> the <unk> ' <unk>
the result is a generation of young people whose <unk> and <unk> <unk> is matched only by their good opinion of themselves
the whole notion of <unk> in education was and is part and <unk> of a <unk> <unk> against <unk> <unk> which was and is regarded as <unk> a <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> if as yet <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of all our children
it is not surprising that parents find this <unk> <unk> so attractive
<unk> these same parents do want their children to get a <unk> education as traditionally understood and they have enough common sense to know what that demands
their commitment to <unk> can not <unk> <unk> <unk>
american education 's future will be determined by the degree to which we all of us allow this common sense to <unk> over the <unk> that we also share
the education <unk> will fight against common sense every <unk> of the way
the reasons are complex but one simple reason ought not to be <unk>
<unk> education as it was once called is far more interesting and <unk> to teachers than is <unk> <unk>
it is <unk> for teachers to think they are engaged in <unk> development and even <unk> to <unk> those <unk> tests with often disappointing results
it also provides teachers with a <unk> <unk> as a <unk> since they will have passed <unk> in educational psychology and educational <unk>
i <unk> took such <unk> in college thinking i might end up a <unk>
they could all fairly be described as <unk> <unk>
but it is unfair to <unk> on teachers as <unk> from the educational <unk>
i know many <unk> and on the whole they are seriously committed to <unk> <unk>
they may not be among the best and <unk> of their generation there are very few such people by definition
but they need not be to do their jobs well
yes we all can remember one or two truly <unk> teachers from our school days
but our education <unk> at the hands of those others who were merely <unk> and <unk>
in this sense a <unk> can be compared to one 's family doctor
if he were <unk> he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place
if he is <unk> and <unk> he <unk> us well
our teachers are not an important factor in our educational crisis
whether they are or are not <unk> is a problem of equity it is not an educational problem
it is <unk> <unk> on our teachers to think they would <unk> our children better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more
it is the kind of <unk> the teachers ' unions do n't mind <unk> for their own narrow purposes
it is also the kind of <unk> politicians find <unk> since it helps them strike a friendly <unk> on behalf of an important <unk>
but there is not one <unk> of evidence that other things being equal salary <unk> result in educational <unk>
if there were such evidence you can be sure you would have heard of it
if we wish to be serious about american education we know exactly what to do and just as important what not to do
there are many successful schools <unk> throughout this nation some of them in the <unk> of <unk> and they are all sending us the same message
<unk> there are the majority of unsuccessful schools and we know which efforts at educational reform are <unk> <unk>
we really do know all we need to know if only we could <unk> this <unk> into our thinking
in this <unk> it would be <unk> if our political leaders were <unk> rather than <unk> concerned
they are <unk> <unk> to <unk> the conventional <unk> since this is the least controversial option that is open to them
thus at the recent <unk> ' conference on education gov. bill <unk> of arkansas announced that this country needs a <unk> <unk> policy for children under five
a <unk> development policy for <unk> over N would seem to be a more <unk> need
what gov. <unk> is <unk> in effect is <unk> the educational system down to the <unk> years
whether <unk> or not this is a <unk> program not an educational program
we know that very early exposure to <unk> <unk> performance in the first <unk> but <unk> the difference is quickly <unk> away
let us sum up what we do know about education and about those education reforms that do work and do n't work <unk> involvement is a bad idea
parents are too likely to blame schools for the educational <unk> of their children
parents should be involved with their children 's education at home not in school
they should see to it that their kids do n't play <unk> they should make certain that the children spend enough time doing <unk> they should <unk> the report <unk>
if parents are <unk> with a school they should have the option of <unk> to another
community involvement is an even worse idea
here the experience of new york city is <unk>
<unk> elected school boards especially in our larger cities become the <unk> of ambitious generally <unk> and <unk> <unk> local politicians or <unk> politicians
new york is in the process of trying to <unk> itself from a <unk> commitment to this system of school <unk> even as chicago and other cities are moving to institute it
in most states increasing expenditures on education in our current circumstances will probably make things worse not better
the reason is simple education takes place in the <unk> where the influence of money is minimal
decades of educational research tell us <unk> that even smaller classes have <unk> effect on the academic performance of the <unk> though they may sometimes be <unk> for other reasons
the new money <unk> into the already <unk> administrative structure which <unk> itself <unk> more and more paper work on the teachers
there is neither <unk> nor <unk> in the fact that as educational expenditures in real terms have increased sharply in the past <unk> we now spend more per <unk> than any other country in the world educational performance has declined
that is the way the system works
students should move up the educational <unk> as their academic potential allows
no student should be permitted to be <unk> from <unk> school without having <unk> the N <unk> 's at the level that <unk> N years ago
this means <unk> whose main purpose is less to permit the <unk> <unk> to <unk> though that is clearly <unk> than to ensure that the less <unk> get the necessary <unk> for further study or for <unk> the modern world of work
the notion that <unk> is <unk> <unk> is <unk>
the purpose of education is to encourage young men and women to realize their full academic potential
no one in his right mind actually believes that we all have an equal academic potential
it is generally <unk> to use older <unk> many of them <unk> out of <unk> rather than <unk> ones
the <unk> are <unk> <unk> often <unk> <unk> and at best <unk>
they are based on <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> rather than on educational experience
one of the reasons american students do so poorly in <unk> tests as compared with british french german or japanese students is the influence of the new <unk> on american <unk> and <unk> methods
anyone who wants to <unk> just how <unk> this situation is with students who ca n't add or <unk> learning the <unk> basis of <unk> theory should read the article by <unk> nelson himself a recent <unk> major at harvard in the november american <unk>
most important of all schools should have <unk> with a large measure of authority over the <unk> the <unk> and all matters of student discipline
study after study the most recent from the <unk> institution tells us that the best schools are those that are free of outside <unk> and are <unk> by a powerful head
with that authority of course goes an <unk> <unk>
schools that are <unk> in this way produce students with higher <unk> and <unk> academic performance
this is a fact though in view of all the <unk> that are <unk> by this fact it is not surprising that one <unk> so little about it
mr. <unk> an american enterprise institute fellow <unk> the public interest and <unk> the national interest
international business machines corp. unveiled a broad strategy to <unk> the biggest problem that manufacturers face when <unk> their operations most machines ca n't talk to each other
the company unveiled more than N products mostly software that are designed to <unk> the three areas of a manufacturing operation the plant floor design operations and production planning
the aim ultimately is to increase the flow of information into a manufacturer 's main computer network for use in business planning marketing and other operations
manufacturers have already spent so heavily on <unk> that they are one of the computer industry 's leading revenue sources
but many manufacturers find that <unk> between different computers has been <unk> nearly impossible by the <unk> of computer <unk> used by different machines including <unk> and machine tools
ibm 's announcement which was expected and will formally be made to customers today also marks an attempt to gain credibility on the plant floor where digital equipment corp. has long dominated and where hewlett-packard co. has recently gained market share
consultants have said that it will take a while for all the pieces of the ibm strategy to fall into place even though the specific products ibm unveiled will generally be available by the end of the first quarter
sam albert a consultant in <unk> n.y. said that in the past ibm has developed broad software strategies only for problems that <unk> industry lines
he said he believes ibm 's decision to invest this sort of effort into a single industry showed that it was getting serious about <unk> customers ' problems and was n't just selling technology
he said he expects ibm to <unk> similar strategies for other industries in coming months
ibm 's push is also unusual in its approach to marketing
rather than just send out marketing people to <unk> on customers ' <unk> ibm is making several hundred of its own manufacturing people available to discuss specific needs
ibm 's manufacturing staff also will be able to provide software that ibm has developed <unk> and will be able to form <unk> with a customer to jointly <unk> manufacturing problems
ibm can obviously bring its <unk> to bear on problems related to computer manufacturing but it could also help customers on software to deal with such things as changes in engineering documents

the tougher new regulations under the <unk> bailout law are <unk> the thrift industry 's <unk> act
largely to meet tougher new capital requirements thrifts reduced their assets $ N billion in august by selling such assets as mortgage-backed securities and loans
industry assets as of aug. N were $ N trillion the lowest since august N
as thrifts sell assets to improve their <unk> ratio as required under the new law passed in august they must also reduce liabilities such as deposits
as interest rates paid <unk> were lowered thrift <unk> exceeded deposits by $ N billion not including interest <unk> to accounts
it was the third consecutive month in which thrifts <unk> assets to increase the size of their capital in <unk> to their assets the office of thrift <unk> said
the asset <unk> was particularly <unk> in several large california institutions
the <unk> of the thrift industry is well under way said <unk> <unk> an industry consultant in <unk> <unk>
this suggests the bailout law is having a more dramatic effect than anyone would have <unk> so soon
james <unk> an economist with the office of thrift <unk> also attributed some of the <unk> to seasonal factors
august is a month when people are paying school tuition he said
that and adjustment to the new law were the biggest factors in the industry
not including thrifts under government <unk> <unk> reduced their assets by $ N billion from the previous month and deposit <unk> totaled $ N billion
for the N insolvent thrifts under government management at the end of august assets declined by $ N billion and <unk> exceeded deposits by $ N billion
thrifts raised capital mostly by selling mortgages and mortgage-backed securities which were reduced by $ N billion in august from the prior month
as of aug. N thrifts held $ N billion in mortgage-backed securities
the deposit numbers for august marked a <unk> back to huge <unk> after a july net deposit <unk> of $ N million the only net <unk> in more than a year
deposits are n't expected to exceed <unk> in the <unk> future as the industry continues to <unk>
i think we are going to see deposit <unk> continue unless we see big changes in rates mr. <unk> said
for the first eight months of N thrifts ' <unk> exceeded deposits by $ N billion
for the prior year deposits exceeded <unk> by $ N billion
the estimates of real gross national product prepared by the bureau of economic analysis in the department of commerce significantly <unk> the rate of economic growth
since the bureau 's estimates for the business sector provide the <unk> for the productivity <unk> calculated by the department of labor <unk> growth rates <unk> <unk> official productivity statistics
if this <unk> is correct it has important implications for <unk> policies it may lower the sense of <unk> behind efforts to <unk> tax incentives and other measures to increase the rate of growth in productivity and real gnp
it would also affect the <unk> of the board of <unk> of the federal reserve system and the informed public generally as to what <unk> a reasonable degree of price <unk>
in the early 1980s i predicted a significant <unk> in productivity growth over the rest of the decade
this forecast was based on the apparent <unk> of most of the negative forces such as <unk> changes the oil shock and <unk> inflation that had reduced productivity gains in the 1970s
there has indeed been more than a one percentage point improvement in productivity growth since N
but i had expected more which is one reason i began looking at evidence <unk> <unk> in the official output estimates
the evidence does not clearly support the view that the downward bias in output growth has become greater during the N period but all i am <unk> is that the growth trend is <unk>
it is however possible that further study will <unk> increasing bias
this bias is in no way <unk>
the <unk> of growth is due largely to the conservative <unk> adopted to deal with <unk> in basic economic data
the first of three major sources of error is the use of labor <unk> estimates mainly employment or hours instead of output estimates for those sectors such as governments paid household services and private <unk> institutions where there are difficulties in <unk> output data
this means that no <unk> is made for possible increases in output per unit of labor
in an <unk> program in which the labor department does estimate output per employee for more than two-thirds of federal <unk> employees it found an average annual rate of productivity improvement of N N during the 1980s
even if it is assumed that productivity rose no more than half as quickly in the rest of the <unk> sector this labor department estimate indicates a downward bias in the real gnp estimates of N percentage point a year on average
the federal productivity <unk> use labor <unk> rather than output data for their calculations of half of private financial and service industries as well
independent estimates of output in those industries including one by the department of labor for banking suggests that productivity in finance and services appears to have risen by an average of at least N N a year between N and N
because finance and services <unk> N N to final business product missing these productivity improvements <unk> the overall growth rate by N N a year
the second source of error in growth statistics is the use of <unk> <unk> to <unk> for price changes
i estimate that these <unk> as detailed by martin n. <unk> and robert j. <unk> add a further N percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate of real business product
finally the official estimates <unk> growth because they make <unk> <unk> for improvements in quality of goods and services
in N a new price index for computers adjusted for changes in performance <unk> was introduced and that resulted in a significantly larger increase in real <unk> for durable goods than the earlier estimates had showed
since then further research <unk> that failure to take account of quality improvements has contributed a total of at least N percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate
in sum the <unk> <unk> above indicate a N percentage point <unk> in growth of total real gnp
for the private domestic business economy the bias was a bit over N percentage point
in other words the growth rates of both total gnp and real private business product per labor hour have been <unk> by about N N

union carbide corp. said third-quarter net income plunged N N from a year earlier on weakness in the company 's <unk> chemicals and plastics business
net was $ N million or N cents a share for the quarter compared with $ N million or $ N a share a year ago
sales were $ N billion up N N from $ N billion the previous year
carbide like other companies with a heavy <unk> on the so-called commodity end of the chemicals industry was expected to post earnings sharply lower than in an <unk> strong N third quarter
but the company 's latest quarter was a few <unk> a share lower than the more <unk> projections on wall street
it certainly was n't a disaster but it does show weakness in some of the company 's chief markets said george <unk> a <unk> analyst at oppenheimer & co
in new york stock exchange composite trading carbide closed at $ N a share down N cents
prices for <unk> a common plastic and an important carbide product started to fall early this year the slide <unk> in the third quarter as buyers continued to <unk> inventories
prices also fell for <unk> <unk> and <unk> products used in making <unk>
some producers of <unk> <unk> the <unk> reductions are near an end have announced price <unk>
the first real test of whether prices have hit bottom may come in the next several weeks when the new prices become effective
a carbide spokesman said the conditions are right for the increase to hold
for the third quarter operating profit from carbide 's chemicals and plastics business fell to $ N million from $ N million a year ago before accounting for taxes and interest expense
operating profit from <unk> products such as <unk> <unk> also declined to $ N million from $ N million
in the <unk> segment operating profit climbed to $ N million from $ N million
the latest quarter included a gain of about $ N million on the sale of the company 's <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> businesses
<unk> <unk> are used in making <unk> products such as <unk> and <unk> <unk> are used in making the <unk> <unk> found in furniture <unk> and other products
that gain was mostly offset by a loss of about $ N million from a <unk> in its <unk> business

at least N states are <unk> drexel burnham lambert inc. 's nationwide effort to settle its legal troubles and some might instead try to <unk> the firm 's license to sell securities within their <unk>
the <unk> of some states to let drexel off the <unk> could <unk> the firm 's attempts to polish its image after its guilty plea to six <unk> last month say several people familiar with the discussions
up to now drexel has made a <unk> series of <unk> with N states and the <unk> of puerto rico
just yesterday new hampshire announced it made a $ N settlement with drexel a <unk> fine for a <unk> matter in that state
these states have been <unk> into <unk> with drexel as part of the firm 's efforts to operate <unk> <unk> in the u.s. despite its record as an admitted <unk>
but individuals familiar with the generally successful drexel talks say the firm is meeting resistance from some big states including new jersey new york california pennsylvania connecticut and missouri
officials in some of these states say they do n't want to simply accept the <unk> offered by drexel
they question if drexel is getting easier treatment than the many small <unk> firms whose brokerage licenses are <unk> <unk>
drexel has to settle with state securities regulators in the wake of its criminal guilty plea and a related civil settlement with the securities and exchange commission that includes payment of $ N million in penalties
these stem from a two-year federal investigation of insider trading and securities fraud on wall street
ohio the district of columbia tennessee and illinois have been less <unk> to drexel than the other six states but <unk> have refused to settle so far say those familiar with the discussions
drexel says it does n't expect any of its state brokerage licenses will be <unk> and even if some are its securities business would n't be directly hurt
it already has sold its retail or <unk> brokerage network securities firms do n't need brokerage licenses for <unk> activities such as investment banking
still if nothing else a <unk> brokerage license could be a burden because it must be disclosed in many of the transactions in which drexel could be involved
securities regulators <unk> drexel for its <unk> effort led by <unk> general counsel <unk> s. cohen to settle its legal problems with the states
but they <unk> about the message these <unk> give to the public
there was a lot of internal debate about that specific issue said <unk> <unk> <unk> 's chief securities <unk> and president of the north american securities <unk> association which <unk> a <unk> settlement plan for the states with drexel
the question she said is whether drexel should be allowed to pay and move on or whether you should simply <unk> the license when someone is convicted of a <unk>
while ms. <unk> 's state went ahead and accepted drexel 's settlement offer of $ N she said i do n't have any argument with those who came to different <unk>
i can see both sides
<unk> <unk> <unk> new hampshire 's director of securities <unk> said his state had n't received any complaints about drexel so it really could n't press the issue
still i understand the reasons that other states are holding out he said
mr. cohen the drexel general counsel said i do n't think as we say in investment banking that by the end of the day we 'll be losing any licenses
asked about states that are taking a hard line he said there are states that have asked for additional information which we are providing to them
mr. cohen said more than $ N million has been paid to N states and that drexel still expects to pay out a total of $ N million
by the end of this week drexel should have another three to four <unk> mr. cohen said
the rate we 're going i think that by the end of the month we 're looking to have a total of N to N he said
that total would be important for drexel
the investment bank has previously announced that as part of its <unk> it would create an independent foundation to promote <unk> behavior in the securities industry
a <unk> to that promise is that a minimum of N states reach settlement agreements before next tuesday
there are according to several securities <unk> at least N states that are either close to <unk> with drexel or who do n't appear opposed to <unk>
drexel 's proposed state <unk> have been based on a state 's population and on the size of drexel 's business in the state
new jersey for example was asked to accept $ N but refused
the state is n't ruling out <unk> drexel 's brokerage license
the state can also bar drexel as an investment adviser
state officials wo n't <unk> their position in <unk> but james <unk> smith state securities chief said we really are still looking at it and have informed drexel that the proposal is really not sufficient for settlement
connecticut already has issued a notice of intent to <unk> drexel 's brokerage license
it is one of the states that have met with mr. cohen and asked for additional information about investors ' accounts and other matters
this particular issue goes to the very <unk> of the <unk> market state banking commissioner howard brown said
a banking department spokesman added commissioner brown does n't feel that money alone is the issue here
particularly <unk> are the cases of new york which is drexel 's base and california the base of drexel 's highly profitable junk-bond operation that led to the firm 's legal difficulties
neither state has settled and officials in the two states wo n't discuss their reasons for not doing so
but drexel has made it clear it could <unk> a significant legal battle in each state if its license is <unk> according to state officials
ms. <unk> the head of the state securities group said drexel has done a better job of <unk> with the states than <unk> hutton did after its guilty plea to a massive <unk> scheme several years ago
still she said drexel 's trouble with some states is n't a bad thing
this process should point out that it 's not going to be easy for a firm that 's convicted of a <unk> to immediately jump back into the retail business ms. <unk> said
we need to have somebody worried so they do n't do this again
these are the N states including the <unk> of puerto rico that have settled with drexel <unk> arkansas delaware georgia <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> kansas <unk> <unk> maryland minnesota <unk> new hampshire new mexico north <unk> <unk> <unk> south carolina south <unk> <unk> <unk> washington <unk> and puerto rico

the <unk> of the exchange 's problems may not become known for some time because of lloyd 's practice of leaving the books open for three years to allow for the settlement of claims
lloyd 's only recently reported its financial results for N
that year it posted record pretax profit of # N million a gain it <unk> to higher rates and fewer claims
but mr. lawrence says reported profit will be down in N N and N though he declines to <unk> how steep the decline will be
insurance analysts say the exchange 's downturn in profitability is likely to be <unk> by more than $ N million in aviation losses including the N pan am airline disaster over <unk> <unk> and a <unk> <unk> of claims from september 's hurricane hugo
lloyd 's says the <unk> of names is n't likely to hurt its underwriting capacity currently about # N billion
mr. lawrence says the <unk> of funds has been offset by an increase in investments by the remaining names
meanwhile the exchange has been trying to lower costs
it recently cut its work force by N N or N
but lloyd 's is <unk> in its efforts to overhaul operations by its <unk> to <unk> modern technology
mr. <unk> the underwriter <unk> half of his business could be <unk> by computer cutting costs at least N N
though lloyd 's has talked for years about <unk> underwriting transactions the effort has n't gotten very far
competition among underwriters and brokers makes them <unk> to <unk> price and policy information
both groups <unk> to traditional <unk> dealings even for <unk> policies
lloyd 's <unk> <unk> also <unk> efforts to <unk> marketing strategies
some underwriters have been <unk> for years to <unk> the <unk> business by selling some policies directly to consumers
lloyd 's <unk> sells only auto insurance directly to the public and such policies are sold only in limited markets such as the u.k. and canada
but such changes must be <unk> by four internal committees and <unk> of underwriters brokers and <unk> before being <unk>
the proposal to sell directly to the public remains <unk> in <unk> <unk>
lloyd 's is moving forward on some <unk> though
mr. lawrence says the exchange is <unk> some procedures to make <unk> payments on claims
by next year all underwriters will be linked to a communications network that could reduce paper work on claims
japan 's daiwa securities co. named <unk> dozen president
mr. dozen succeeds <unk> <unk> who will become vice chairman
<unk> <unk> <unk> his title of chairman of daiwa japan 's second-largest securities firm
in japanese firms the president usually is in charge of <unk> operations while the chairman 's role is more a <unk> one
the title of chief executive officer is n't used
while people within daiwa particularly <unk> expected that mr. dozen N would eventually become daiwa 's president the speed of his promotion surprised many
it was only earlier this year that the <unk> <unk> executive he <unk> to <unk> with americans about how his name is <unk> with <unk> was appointed deputy president
mr. dozen is taking over the <unk> of a securities company that does very well in its domestic market but that is still seeking to realize its potential in global investment banking and securities dealing
daiwa is one of the world 's largest securities firms
as of march N the daiwa group had shareholder equity of N billion yen $ N billion
for the six months ended sept. N daiwa reported <unk> parent company net income of N billion yen $ N million on revenue of N billion yen $ N billion
both figures were record <unk>
several observers interpreted mr. dozen 's appointment as an attempt by daiwa to make its international operations more profitable while preparing the firm for the effects of the continuing <unk> of japan 's domestic markets which should mean increased competition
all of japan 's so-called big four securities firms nomura securities co. ltd. the world 's largest <unk> securities co. ltd. <unk> securities co. ltd. and daiwa have suffered <unk> in their attempts to break into foreign markets
while they have moved to the <unk> in underwriting fixed-income securities in the <unk> market mostly for japanese firms they have been only <unk> profitable if at all in the u.s.
american institutional investors have never had a large <unk> for japanese equities
and while the japanese have stepped up their purchases of u.s. shares in the past several months they have shown themselves in the past to be <unk> investors
at the same time daiwa and its <unk> have faced <unk> competition from <unk> american competitors that have <unk> them from building strong <unk> to u.s. corporations and institutional investors
mr. dozen knows these problems <unk>
when he arrived in the u.s. in N the start of an <unk> <unk> he tried selling japanese <unk> bonds to u.s. investors
he made <unk> efforts using the <unk> pages from beginning to end said <unk> <unk> president of daiwa 's u.s. unit
but not a single piece of paper was sold
by his own account mr. dozen did n't do much better with u.s. bonds
in an interview a few months ago he <unk> how after some training at salomon brothers inc. he <unk> bid for the opportunity to sell <unk> of N u.s. corporate bond issues
but he could n't sell any
japanese stock salesmen selling american bonds
maybe it 's <unk> he said
mr. dozen even related the <unk> suffered when he and two colleagues went on an overnight fishing <unk> off the new jersey shore and caught nothing
upon returning to new york <unk> i got into a <unk> and the woman <unk> said americans make better <unk> he <unk>
<unk> mr. dozen said that daiwa 's goal is to build a <unk> <unk> international organization with maybe some japanese <unk> to it
he said that he was particularly interested in his firm <unk> <unk> in futures options <unk> securities <unk> trading and investment systems as well as mergers and acquisitions
mr. dozen said daiwa 's <unk> were its large capital base its <unk> position in the tokyo market and its <unk> to japanese corporations and institutional investors
mr. dozen joined daiwa upon his <unk> from <unk> university in N
like many young <unk> in japanese securities firms he began his career <unk> stock to individual investors
in his climb to the top mr. dozen also headed the company 's <unk> division its fixed-income units and its international operations
he was <unk> <unk> up new things to fill out his experience he is very <unk> said <unk> <unk> chairman of daiwa 's u.s. unit in new york
but it mr. dozen 's experience as a salesman that <unk> him to gain the political support particularly from the retail sales force to <unk> to the <unk>
commission income from domestic stock and bond sales accounts form a large portion of japanese securities companies ' earnings
and anybody who <unk> the backing of the retail sales force would be <unk> said a daiwa executive
if mr. dozen has a weakness it may be his <unk> game
he <unk> in the sand instead of <unk> the ball like a farmer said mr. <unk>
inco ltd. posted a N N decline in third-quarter net income a performance that was in line with analysts ' expectations
the <unk> producer also raised its quarterly dividend to N cents a share from N cents and said it may buy back as much as N N of its common outstanding
inco shares fell after the announcements
analysts said some investors were <unk> that the <unk> company had failed to announce a special dividend
inco closed at $ N a share down N cents in new york stock exchange composite trading
some analysts said inco which had cash reserves of $ N million as of sept. N could still announce a special dividend in the next few months though it would be smaller than the $ <unk> special dividend it paid last year
the quarterly dividend is payable dec. N to shares of record nov. N
inco 's net fell to $ N million or $ N a share in the third quarter from $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier
sales rose N N to $ N million from $ N million
excluding special gains from <unk> <unk> earnings in the latest quarter were $ N million or $ N a share compared with $ N million or $ N a share
inco said the drop in earnings resulted mainly from lower <unk> prices for the period and a temporary cut in <unk> output at the company 's <unk> operations due to high levels of <unk> in the <unk>
inco said it plans to buy back as many as five million common shares over the next N months if <unk> market conditions are favorable
under a previous <unk> program inco has purchased N million of its shares since april
ual corp. 's board <unk> any prospects for an immediate <unk> of a labor-management buy-out saying united airlines ' parent should remain independent for now
as a result ual 's chairman stephen m. wolf pulled out of the buy-out effort to focus on running the company
the two developments put the acquisition attempt back to square one and leaves the airline with an <unk> of <unk> matters including an <unk> labor situation and a management <unk> to restore its damaged credibility
the effort to create the nation 's largest <unk> company began <unk> oct. N when the labor-management group was unable to obtain financing for its $ 300-a-share $ N billion offer
just last week it suffered another major setback when british airways plc the largest equity investor in the labor-management bid withdrew its support
takeover stock traders focusing on the company 's <unk> to stay independent took the announcement as bad news
ual which had risen $ N to $ N in composite trading on the new york stock exchange on reports of a new bid being prepared by the group <unk> course and plummeted in <unk> trading after the N p.m. edt announcement
among the first trades reported by the securities firm of <unk> & co. which makes a market in ual after the exchange is closed were N shares at $ N N shares at $ N N at $ N and N at $ N
the rebound in ual stock during regular trading hours monday was its first daily gain after six consecutive losses left the price N N below its level before oct. N the day the group announced the bank financing could n't be obtained for the original deal
<unk> of ual 's outside directors met at a <unk> meeting yesterday in chicago to consider an <unk> proposal from the buy-out group for a revised bid
but the board said it was n't interested for now
that proposal valued at between $ N and $ N a share would have transferred majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands
the buy-out group had no firm financing for the plan
and with no other offers on the table the board apparently felt no pressure to act on it
the directors <unk> however that they would be willing to consider future offers or take some other action to <unk> shareholder value saying they would continue to <unk> all strategic and financial alternatives
but it was clear that for the time being the board wants the company to return to <unk>
the board said it concluded that the <unk> of the company its shareholders its employees and the broader public can best be enhanced by continued development of ual as a strong <unk> independent company
mr. wolf urged all employees to now turn their full attention to operating the airline
he also <unk> to make every effort to <unk> a <unk> new relationship that has been <unk> with participating employee groups
but mr. wolf faces a <unk> task in <unk> the company back together again
labor problems top the list
for a brief time the buy-out effort seemed to <unk> his problems with united 's pilot union
in return for an ownership stake in the company the pilots were willing to agree to a <unk> contract that included a <unk> <unk> and significant wage concessions and productivity gains the union previously <unk>
that contract was tied to the success of the buy-out
as a <unk> measure the pilots had been working four extra hours a month and had agreed to fly ual 's two new boeing N aircraft
it 's uncertain if the pilots will continue to do so without a contract settlement
the union said late last night that it is still committed to majority employee ownership and that the labor <unk> that faced the company prior to the buy-out effort still need to be <unk>
the buy-out effort also <unk> <unk> relations between united 's pilot and <unk> unions
the machinists ' <unk> of the labor-management bid and their <unk> of a strike unless they received substantial wage increases this year helped cool banks ' interest in financing the transaction
the machinists previously had shown themselves to be an <unk> to mr. wolf but he lost much of his credibility with that group when he <unk> up with the pilot union
the machinists criticized the terms mr. wolf and management received in the buy-out
they paid $ N million for a N N stake and received an additional N N of the company at no additional cost
his credibility is also on the line in the investment community
until the collapse of this bid mr. wolf was regarded as one of the nation 's <unk> airline executives after engineering <unk> of tiger international inc. and republic airlines
but he and his chief financial officer john <unk> <unk> some of the <unk> for the deal 's failure by <unk> banks accept low financing fees and interest rates while they invested in the transaction only a small <unk> of the $ N million they stood to gain from sale of their ual stock and options
the board 's actions leave takeover stock traders <unk> some $ N million in losses and eager to respond to anyone who might make a new offer
it also <unk> leaves a <unk> of shareholder lawsuits
<unk> said they were <unk> the company did n't announce some recapitalization or other plan to <unk> value
one takeover expert noted that <unk> could force a recapitalization through the written consent process under which holders may <unk> the board by a majority vote
the machinists union has suggested it may <unk> a recapitalization that includes a special dividend for holders and a minority ownership stake for employees
los angeles investor marvin davis whose $ <unk> offer for ual in august triggered a bidding war says he remains interested in the airline
however he is restricted from making certain hostile moves by an agreement he signed to obtain <unk> ual data
essentially he ca n't make any hostile moves unless he makes a tender offer at least $ N a share
tandy corp. said it wo n't join u.s. memories the group that seeks to battle the japanese in the market for computer memory chips
tandy 's decision is a second setback for u.s. memories
last month apple computer inc. said that it would n't invest in the group
apple said that its money would be better spent in areas such as research and development
u.s. memories is seeking major investors to back its attempt to crack the $ N billion market for <unk> <unk> access memory chips a market dominated by the japanese
those chips were in <unk> shortage last year <unk> many u.s. computer companies that could n't get sufficient <unk> chips
tandy said its experience during the shortage did n't <unk> the $ N million to $ N million investment u.s. memories is seeking from each investor
at this time we elected not to get involved because we have been able to <unk> our need for <unk> from the market as a rule said <unk> <unk> tandy 's director of market planning
sanford <unk> u.s. memories president said the decision was disappointing but does n't <unk> u.s. memories ' failure
i would like to have had them he said
but they were n't on my list of companies who were critical to be a part of it
mr. <unk> became president and chief executive officer of u.s. memories last june when the group was formed by seven electronics companies advanced <unk> devices inc. digital equipment corp. hewlett-packard co. intel corp. international business machines corp. <unk> <unk> corp. and national semiconductor corp
mr. <unk> said he expects two or three major corporations to announce their participation in u.s. memories soon after the group <unk> a business plan probably late this week
u.s. memories needs a <unk> he said to <unk> others to join
but so far most potential participants have n't decided
sun <unk> inc. said it 's still actively <unk> u.s. memories and plans to meet with u.s. memories representatives later this week
american telephone & telegraph co. said it was waiting to see u.s. memories ' business plan
<unk> maker <unk> research inc. said it is still studying the situation
a compaq computer corp. spokeswoman said that the company has n't made a decision yet although it is n't under active consideration
in a <unk> <unk> members of the senate intelligence committee are <unk> that someone in the executive branch is <unk> on them
david <unk> the intelligence committee chairman is <unk> that someone <unk> a letter to the committee from the reagan administration <unk> that the u.s. would <unk> to <unk> panamanian <unk> <unk> noriega if it got wind of an <unk> coup that might result in his assassination
with due <unk> to highly <unk> <unk> and other <unk> the <unk> are <unk> a public service
if the cia has become a protection service for mr. noriega the american people ought to know
what went wrong in panama is a <unk> subject for public and congressional inquiry
naturally senator <unk> and his committee would like free <unk> to blame the executive branch while <unk> top secret on their own <unk>
but there 's no danger of <unk> sources and methods in <unk> the debate running up and down pennsylvania avenue
and if congress is going to assume authority to <unk> foreign policy it 's going to have to take some of the responsibility too
the president of the united states urged the panamanian <unk> forces to move against mr. noriega
when they did his <unk> did n't have the initiative to do more than block a couple of roads
the executive branch <unk> the first responsibility for <unk>
but what kind of initiative can you expect given the climate set by congress
for example what exactly did the cia tell major <unk> and his fellow coup <unk> about u.s. laws and executive orders on <unk>
what part did u.s. <unk> play in the major 's <unk> to <unk> the <unk> when he had general noriega in <unk> but was under attack by <unk> troops
mr. noriega did n't suffer from any <unk> once he had the <unk>
maybe we need a cia version of the <unk> warning you have the right to <unk> your coup <unk> because we may <unk> on you
or maybe a <unk> general 's warning <unk> in the united states may be <unk>
cia chief william webster hardly a washington <unk> got the debate started last week by noting that the executive order <unk> <unk> had contributed to u.s. <unk> during the coup
the cia 's deputy director of operations richard <unk> tried to <unk> things over a few days later but instead simply <unk> mr. webster 's point
the <unk> of the executive order mr. <unk> said and the way in which the various committees have over time interpreted it has led in my view to a <unk> caution on the part of operators including me
in other words congress wo n't let the cia do much of anything <unk> and that 's fine with the cia
the pay 's the same and the duty 's <unk>
and of course doing anything that might be <unk> by congress carries heavy penalties
witness the <unk> <unk> of <unk> north
the intelligence committee 's <unk> republican senator william cohen joined with senator george mitchell to write a best seller about <unk> <unk> men of <unk>
no doubt many people in the cia the pentagon and the national security council have read it
what kind of initiative should anyone expect from people out on the line who 've read all this and know what can happen if they fail
who wants to end up as the <unk> in a bill cohen <unk> play
the order against <unk> is another <unk> of the same congressional <unk> a product of the 1970s vietnam <unk> against any executive action
president bush would do himself and the country a favor by <unk> the order as an <unk> <unk> on his ability to defend america 's national security
there are of course good reasons the u.s. should n't get into the assassination business but <unk> the executive order is not the same thing as saying the u.s. should start passing out <unk> <unk>
the world being the <unk> place it is we want <unk> to have the freedom to order operations in which someone might get killed
in such <unk> you can not write rules in advance you can only make sure the president takes the responsibility
the executive order and the reported agreements with the intelligence committee are neither <unk> nor <unk>
as it now stands the u.s. can <unk> <unk> but ca n't <unk> <unk> <unk>
it can send a <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> valley but ca n't <unk> <unk> <unk>
both the assassination order and the quality of debate in washington are telling the world that the only way the u.s. will kill a <unk> is by making sure we take some <unk> <unk> with him
we 've heard california 's <unk> <unk> N blamed for a lot over the years but abc 's ted <unk> came up with a new <unk> in his earthquake coverage last week when he asked democratic <unk> richard katz if <unk> N had <unk> money needed for road maintenance

manville having <unk> itself of asbestos now sells <unk> forest products minerals and industrial goods
<unk> stuff it 's not
but manville 's ownership is unusual and it has caught the eye of some <unk> and <unk> investors
the <unk> concern which emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings late last year is controlled by the manville personal <unk> settlement trust
the trust which owns N N of manville 's stock on a fully diluted basis is a separate legal <unk> that is <unk> claims with asbestos victims
when and if the trust runs out of cash which seems increasingly likely it will need to convert its manville stock to cash
but as an N N owner if it tried to sell much of its stock in the market it would likely <unk> the price of its shares
some investors say there is a good chance that the trust will instead seek to convert the company 's shares to cash in some sort of friendly restructuring that would n't involve just <unk> stock on the market
their principal asset is manville common stock says jeffrey <unk> who runs <unk> associates an investment fund that owns manville shares
if they tried to sell they 'd be <unk> their own <unk>
what makes the most sense is to find someone who wants to buy the whole company or cause a recapitalization of all shares
the trust is n't <unk> on when it might need to <unk> its manville stock
however the trust 's cash flow from investments is far short of its payments to asbestos victims
its cash and liquid securities fell by $ N million in the first six months of N
the trust also will receive $ N million a year starting in N on a bond it holds from manville
and beginning in N it will have a claim on as much as N N of manville 's annual net income
even so the trust would seem to be facing a cash <unk>
as of june N it had settled only about N of the N received claims from asbestos victims for an average of $ N each
the average should drop over time since the most expensive claims are being settled first
and as of <unk> settled but <unk> claims <unk> to $ N million more than half the trust 's total of $ N million in cash and <unk> securities
at some point we 're going to need an <unk> of funds a person close to the trust says
even before then the trust may be eager to <unk> manville stock
it does n't pay a dividend and this trust needs income
moreover with N N of its assets tied up in manville the trust is badly in need of <unk>
obviously a <unk> portfolio would have less risk the person close to the trust says
manville itself does n't rule out a restructuring
though the <unk> is barely <unk> on its new <unk> law structure bill <unk> manville 's head of investor relations says the company is <unk> <unk> whether there is a better way to be <unk>
we understand that the trust is ultimately going to need to sell some of our shares he says
of course one option would be for manville to buy out the trust 's shares which would do little to benefit public stockholders
but the trust in most cases is <unk> from seeking a buyer for only its shares before november N
and both the trust and manville are seeking to avoid the bad publicity that in the asbestos era <unk> the manville name
thus analysts say the trust is unlikely to do anything that would hurt manville 's other shareholders
this is a <unk> case of a company with a big majority holder which will probably act in the interests of the minority holders one investor says
even if there is no restructuring manville seems to be attractive long-term
its stock at N N trades at about N N times estimated N earnings an <unk> low <unk> for a company with <unk> customers
mr. <unk> says N N of revenues are tied to construction
analysts predict little or no <unk> growth
they are <unk> high on manville 's management
it 's one of the best in the business says salomon brothers analyst stephen <unk>
and he says manville has the financial flexibility to buy other companies at the best possible moment when other <unk> firms are <unk> and selling cheap
with a conservative <unk> ratio of <unk> and $ N million in cash manville is indeed actively on the <unk>
so far as a <unk> <unk> manville has n't bought much
paul <unk> an analyst at <unk> & <unk> says even though they have borrowing power they have been <unk> about acquisitions

as a result of the partial sale and spinoff the $ N billion california public employees retirement system would obtain two seats on the board of the real estate operation according to officials of the fund who described the plan
a spokesman for chicago-based santa fe pacific confirmed that negotiations were being held with the fund
also holding two seats each on the board they said would be <unk> & york developments ltd. controlled by the <unk> family of canada and <unk> corp. controlled by chicago businessman sam <unk>

<unk> bought a N N stake in <unk> fe pacific last year and <unk> & york later purchased about a N N stake they would have interests in the new realty company in line with their holdings in <unk> fe pacific
the sale and spinoff of the real estate unit is the first phase of what could lead to the <unk> of santa fe pacific into <unk> companies for its railroad and energy operations as well as real estate
the <unk> parent has been under pressure from large shareholders to boost the company 's share price
at the same time it has been caught in an earnings squeeze
the california pension fund 's planned investment in the real estate unit is unusual
pension funds rarely own as much as a N N stake in what is expected to be a publicly traded company
in addition pension funds are rarely given seats on company boards and most often try to avoid them because of legal concerns
but fund officials said the santa fe pacific realty investment provides an opportunity to buy a stake in a large real estate portfolio heavily <unk> with california properties
it also marks a major commitment to real estate development which we have n't been involved with before said <unk> <unk> the fund 's executive director
under the proposed plan the fund would also lend santa fe pacific realty $ N million in the form of a note that would be convertible into additional shares of the realty company after the second year at the <unk> market price
the note would <unk> interest at the rate of N N a year which would be payable to the fund after five years according to stephen e. <unk> a real estate consultant working for the fund
the purpose of the note is to provide added capital for the <unk> company in a form that will save it spending cash on immediate interest payments mr. <unk> said
the <unk> concern clearly will be one of the dominant real estate development companies with a prime portfolio he said
for the last year santa fe pacific has <unk> its real estate operations toward <unk> development of its properties <unk> profits that the parent had <unk> in the past from <unk> sales from its portfolio
real estate operating income for the first nine months fell to $ N million from $ N million a year earlier the company said
in a statement late yesterday santa fe pacific 's chairman robert d. <unk> said that santa fe pacific realty would <unk> more than $ N million in debt owed to the parent before the planned spinoff
that would help reduce santa fe pacific 's remaining debt to about $ N million from a high of $ N billion in early N
it was n't clear where santa fe pacific expected to obtain the payment of more than $ N million which would be well above the $ N million that california pension fund officials say they plan to provide
the realty unit might take on new debt or obtain additional investors among other <unk>
the santa fe pacific spokesman declined to comment on that <unk> saying the deal was still under <unk>
santa fe pacific realty owns N million acres of property including N buildings with more than N million square feet of space
it also holds nearly N acres of raw land with development potential but under a previously announced strategy the company has <unk> building on N acres in california arizona and the chicago area
among those are the N acres in the san francisco bay area including N acres in the mission bay area
the california pension fund which has $ N billion already invested in real estate and mortgages could be a valuable funding source for that development although it is n't <unk> to make further investments
the fund is the nation 's largest public employee fund and it has a growing cash flow now <unk> $ N billion a year
fund officials negotiated the final structure of the proposed deal with santa fe pacific but they were approached with the idea by real estate brokers <unk> realty corp. of chicago
<unk> officials are expected to be hired to represent the pension fund on the santa fe pacific realty board mr. <unk> said to <unk> the fund from potential liability problems

but instead of thanks sen. <unk> was <unk> with cool <unk>
every witness receives a formal <unk> rep. gonzalez told him
<unk> have house hearings caused so much <unk> in the senate where california sen. <unk> and four other senators were already <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> publicity over the alleged <unk> of lincoln by their friend and political <unk> charles keating jr. principal <unk> of lincoln 's parent company american continental corp. of phoenix <unk>

mr. keating arranged nearly $ N million in donations to sen. <unk> and his various political causes and hundreds of thousands more to other lawmakers
future witnesses include a former federal s&l <unk> who has accused the five senators of attempting to <unk> the regulatory process by <unk> on behalf of mr. keating
unlike many lawmakers chairman gonzalez says he <unk> <unk> with regulators to be <unk>
when you reach a point where a <unk> body is trying to shape administrative decisions then that 's a <unk> in my book the texas <unk> says
and he has attached himself to the lincoln story <unk>
unless the questions are <unk> i will keep on going
lawmakers often are reluctant to <unk> colleagues even those of <unk> political parties

there are some witnesses who will be forced to <unk> about their meetings with senators
and a democratic aide to a banking committee member <unk> i too am <unk> by it because gonzalez has certainly placed a lot of democratic senators in a very bad position
all the senators say they merely were trying to ensure <unk> for a <unk>
mr. keating lives in phoenix and the california thrift 's parent is an <unk> corporation with holdings in michigan
chairman gonzalez <unk> <unk> for sen. <unk> his <unk> as chairman of the senate banking committee

most <unk> the senate traded away the bush administration 's controversial plan to finance the bailout which was partly <unk> later
at the time mr. gonzalez said several senators told him that they could get some <unk> out of the way if there could be some <unk> on <unk> 's <unk> on wall
now mr. gonzalez is holding the equivalent of <unk> hearings anyway under the <unk> of the lincoln investigation
in a way that 's what this is mr. gonzalez concedes
even some house banking committee members could suffer from the <unk>
mr. keating raised $ N for rep. <unk> <unk> 's N <unk> campaign while the georgia democrat was taking his side against regulators who wanted to curb risky investments and wholesale deposit <unk>
he recently voted present when the committee authorized a <unk> to <unk> mr. keating to <unk> then changed his vote to yes

the company said earnings would have increased if it had n't been actively <unk> its shares thus increasing its interest expense and reducing its interest income
tandy had N million shares outstanding at sept. N down from N million a year earlier
revenue rose N N to $ N million from $ N million
tandy said consumer electronics sales at its radio <unk> stores have been slow partly because of a lack of hot new products
radio <unk> continues to be lackluster said dennis <unk> analyst with <unk> <unk> & turner in dallas
he said tandy has done a <unk> job increasing sales by manufacturing computers for others and expanding sales of its <unk> systems corp. subsidiary which sells computers to bigger businesses but it 's not enough to offset the problems at radio <unk>
sales at radio <unk> stores open more than a year grew only N N in the quarter from a year earlier he said

tandy earned $ N million or $ N a share in the year ended june N

at a private <unk> thursday drexel burnham lambert inc. chief executive <unk> joseph delivered a <unk> message about the junk bond market to officials of prudential insurance co. of america
mr. joseph conceded the junk market was in <unk> according to people familiar with the <unk>
he said drexel the leading underwriter of high-risk junk bonds could no longer afford to sell any junk offerings if they might later become troubled because drexel <unk> losing its highly <unk> junk franchise
the <unk> was a <unk> <unk> that N is the worst year ever for the $ N billion junk market
and investors and traders <unk> say the current turmoil could take years to <unk>
amid the market <unk> even drexel which has the <unk> and most loyal following of junk bond investors is <unk> in its <unk>
although the big investment bank still <unk> the junk market drexel has been unable to stem the <unk> from growing junk bond defaults <unk> new offerings <unk> by shareholders in junk bond mutual funds and an <unk> of <unk> investors
for many money managers the past four months have been <unk>
this is the worst <unk> ever in the junk market and it could take years before it 's over says mark <unk> a senior vice president at standard & poor 's corp. a credit rating company
in the third quarter for example junk bonds those with less than an investment-grade rating showed negative returns the only major sector of the bond market to do so
since the end of last year junk bonds have been <unk> by all categories of investment-grade bonds including <unk> treasury securities
the junk market which <unk> to $ N billion from less than $ N billion at the start of the decade has been declining for months as <unk> have <unk> under the weight of hefty interest payments
the <unk> market received its biggest <unk> last month from campeau corp. which created its u.s. retailing empire with more than $ N billion in junk financing
campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be <unk> on some interest payments and to put its <unk> <unk> 's department store chain up for sale
at that point the junk market went into a <unk> as buyers <unk> and investors tried to sell
in an interview mr. joseph says his <unk> <unk> with the prudential executives acknowledged problems for junk
what i thought i was saying is that the market is troubled but still <unk> and <unk> enough quite <unk> which is not at all bad he says
nobody 's been perfect in their credit <unk> the past couple years and we 're going to make sure our default rates are going to be in the <unk> <unk> of the market
what has <unk> many junk buyers is the sudden <unk> that junk bonds can not necessarily be bought and sold with the ease of common stocks and many investment-grade bonds
unlike the new york stock exchange where buyers and sellers are quickly matched the junk market where risky corporate loans are traded is sometimes closed for repairs
at closely held <unk> securities corp. junk bond money managers <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> h. <unk> say the problems of the junk market go <unk> than a temporary <unk>
in recent months they say there has been heavy selling of junk bonds by some of the market 's traditional investors while new buyers have n't <unk> to replace them
wall street securities firms the primary source of liquidity for the high yield market have been net sellers of junk bonds because of trading losses <unk> said in a recent <unk> report to customers
mutual funds have also been net sellers of junk bonds as junk 's relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced <unk> <unk> by shareholders <unk> said
investors trying to raise cash have sold large liquid issues such as rjr holdings corp. and <unk> co. declines in these benchmark issues have contributed to the market 's <unk>
and <unk> said buying has been <unk> reduced because savings and loans have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation
in fact savings and loans were sellers of high yield holdings throughout the quarter <unk> said
ms. <unk> and ms. <unk> say they are managing their junk portfolios <unk> building cash and <unk> <unk> the overall quality
meanwhile prudential the nation 's largest insurer and the biggest investor in junk bonds has seen the value of its junk bond portfolio drop to $ N billion from $ N billion since august because of falling junk prices
we certainly do have a lack of liquidity here and it 's something to be concerned about says james a. <unk> a managing director
i have no reason to think things will get worse but this market has a <unk> for surprising us
this market <unk> us to be <unk>
the junk market 's yield <unk> are learning a real <unk> <unk> he says
although the majority of junk bonds outstanding show no signs of default the market has <unk> many junk issues as if they were in trouble says <unk> <unk> manager of <unk> life & casualty insurance co. 's $ N billion investment-grade public bond portfolio
but we think the risks are there for things getting a lot worse
and the risks are n't appropriate for us he says
the big insurer unlike prudential owns only about $ N million of publicly sold junk bonds
the string of big junk bond defaults which have been a major cause of the market 's problems this year probably will <unk> some analysts say
if anything we 're going to see defaults increase because credit ratings have declined says paul <unk> associate professor at the massachusetts institute of technology 's <unk> school of management
mr. <unk> whose study on junk bond defaults caused a <unk> on wall street when it was disclosed last april says this year 's junk bond defaults already show a high <unk> with his own findings
his study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of N N
one indication of a growing number of junk defaults mr. <unk> says is that about half of the $ N billion of corporate bonds outstanding that have been lowered to a default rating by s&p this year are junk bonds sold during the market 's big issue years of N through N
these bonds now rated <unk> include junk offerings by <unk> industries columbia savings colorado first texas savings association <unk> financial corp. integrated resources inc. metropolitan broadcasting corp. resorts international inc. <unk> corp. and <unk> inc
obviously we got a lot more smoke than fire from the people who told us the market was n't so risky says <unk> <unk> professor of finance at university of california 's anderson <unk> school of management in los angeles
mr. <unk> has just completed a study that finds that the risks and returns of junk bonds are less than on common stocks but more than on investment-grade bonds
mr. <unk> says the junk market is no <unk> as drexel claimed but it also is n't a disaster as the <unk> say
despite the junk market 's problems drexel continues to <unk> a loyalty among junk bond investors that its wall street rivals have n't found
during the past three weeks for example drexel has sold $ N billion of new junk bonds for turner broadcasting co. <unk> chemical continental air and <unk> & <unk>
still the list of troubled drexel bond offerings <unk> that of any firm on wall street as does its successful offerings
troubled <unk> issues include resorts international <unk> integrated resources sci tv <unk> holdings western electric and <unk>
quality junk bonds will continue to trade well says michael <unk> chairman of salomon brothers asset management inc

like which are <unk> and which are not
with the fall social season well under way <unk> are out in force trying to <unk> their <unk> and sometimes put down their <unk>
but the truth is that almost everyone from real-estate agents to city <unk> <unk> and a surprising number of people have an <unk> <unk> who claims he lived next door to the <unk> who did the <unk> kids
in case you have <unk> his name was <unk> <unk>
<unk> is <unk> and getting more so as society becomes more complex and <unk> says <unk> <unk> a new york <unk> with a <unk> <unk>
it can be an avenue of <unk> to a certain sector of society
it provides some people a needed sense of <unk> and can help open up a <unk> with someone you do n't know
like the long island <unk> in the theater district the other day who <unk> to a <unk> that she once met <unk> <unk>

mr. <unk> says that at the party he <unk> to malcolm <unk> publisher of <unk> magazine <unk> been in the columns together mary <unk> a new york art dealer i think she knows me but i 'm not sure and <unk> <unk> the <unk> she knows me but we 're not really the best of friends
mr. <unk> the <unk> columnist says there are people who actually plan whose names they are going to drop before <unk> a party
these <unk> do n't <unk> only their <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>
they even drop <unk> names like <unk> <unk> whom everybody these days apparently has heard of but no one really knows says mr. <unk>
it 's the <unk> of <unk> that counts
but <unk> has other benefits often <unk>
in the name of <unk> pride and from the desire to <unk> a negative image some city <unk> seek to link their <unk> with the most <unk> names the city has to offer
take cleveland
it has gotten a bad <unk> because its once heavily <unk> <unk> river caught fire because former mayor ralph <unk> set his <unk> on fire with an <unk> <unk> and because its proposed rock <unk> roll hall of <unk> was recently refused an <unk> grant
some people call it the <unk> on the lake lake <unk> that is
it helps to point out how many important people came through cleveland on their way to the top says george miller executive director of the new cleveland campaign a <unk> organization <unk> to citing the city 's <unk>
mr. miller notes that <unk> paul <unk> 's family owned a <unk> store in cleveland that the late <unk> <unk> <unk> who played the bad <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> once ran a <unk> school in cleveland and that <unk> bob hope 's father a <unk> once worked on a church next to <unk> hall cleveland 's main <unk> hall
power names like that do n't hurt the city 's reputation mr. miller says
in hollywood an average family can gain <unk> from moving into a home <unk> by the famous or near famous
why we even just sold a <unk> house in van <unk> and were able to keep the price firm in a weak real-estate market by noting that the original lone <unk> lived there says david <unk> a sales associate with <unk> douglas co. a los angeles real-estate agency

three of every N buyers under N would prefer to buy a sports car compared with just N N of <unk> N and over according to the journal survey
young consumers prefer luxury cars by a N N to N N margin even though older buyers because of their <unk> are more likely to actually purchase a luxury car

the most controversial of these is stock-index arbitrage in which traders buy or sell <unk> of stocks and offset the position with an <unk> trade in stock-index futures to <unk> in profits
it 's the most controversial form of program trading because it can create <unk> price swings in the stock market

the suit seeks <unk> damages
imperial is in the <unk> of reducing its junk-bond holdings and getting out of the investment banking business in order to return to traditional thrift activities
the derivative suit is similar to a <unk> complaint filed earlier this year
imperial said in a statement it expects other complaints to be filed in the wake of the original suit and a recent article in <unk> 's magazine that <unk> on the company 's problems
although an imperial spokesman said the company had n't yet been served with the derivative suit he <unk> the company 's statement that it would <unk> defend itself against the <unk> suit

<unk> kodak co. seeking to position itself in the potentially huge high-definition television market unveiled a <unk> that can <unk> conventional <unk> film into high-definition video
the move also helps the <unk> n.y. <unk> giant ensure that its <unk> film business for which it holds a <unk> <unk> <unk> every hollywood movie company is n't made <unk> by the <unk> hdtv business
while the <unk> <unk> is costly it 's being <unk> by the <unk> hdtv industry as a way of increasing the number of <unk> shows that can be seen on the new <unk>
the industry has been waiting with <unk> <unk> for the machines to come along says david <unk> president of <unk> <unk> five <unk> inc. a new york <unk> in high-definition programming
he notes that industry executives have until now worried that they would face a severe shortage of programs once consumers begin <unk> their tv sets with <unk>
japanese electronic giants such as sony corp. and hitachi ltd. have <unk> almost entirely on hdtv hardware and virtually ignored software or programs shot in high-definition
and only a handful of small u.s. companies are engaged in high-definition software development
it 's estimated that just about N hours of <unk> programming is currently available for <unk>
kodak says its new <unk> hdtv <unk> will help <unk> the problem by allowing <unk> and <unk> to convert movies and television programs shot in <unk> <unk> film into high-definition video
consumers will be able to <unk> on their hdtv sets and get all the <unk> benefits the <unk> <unk> offers
otherwise they 'd be watching programs that are no different in quality from what they currently view on color <unk>
it would be like watching a black and white movie on a color tv set says malcolm g. <unk> chairman of the film and video department at the <unk> institute of technology
the new <unk> are a critical link between film and the television <unk> says <unk> d. <unk> vice president and general manager of kodak 's motion picture and <unk> products division
kodak wo n't disclose the cost or when its <unk> will be on the market but it 's estimated the machine may be available within two years
a similar machine already on the market made by <unk> <unk> ltd. a unit of <unk> <unk> costs about $ N
and the potential market is tremendous industry experts say
if hdtv takes off in the u.s. there will be demand for some N to N hdtv <unk> known in the industry as <unk>
demand will come first from programming production companies and then from television stations
the <unk> is head and <unk> above anything else i 've seen says richard j. <unk> vice president engineering and development at mca inc. 's universal city <unk>
and mr. <unk> the program producer contends that kodak 's move is a sound marketing decision
they ca n't afford to stay out of hdtv
indeed the stakes are high
the u.s. electronics industry estimates that the hdtv market will total about $ N billion over the next two decades with an additional $ N billion expected to go for related products
<unk> break down <unk> into more than N lines compared with N for today 's <unk> providing <unk> <unk> <unk>
and the sets are wider <unk> the <unk> of a movie screen
but the financial <unk> are n't expected soon nor are they guaranteed
experts estimate the first sets of <unk> wo n't be available for another five to N years and will probably retail for more than $ N each in today 's dollars
some critics say they wo n't be quickly <unk> by consumers because of the high price
nevertheless kodak could n't risk letting hdtv turn its <unk> film business into a <unk>
kodak <unk> hdtv is where everybody is going says <unk> 's mr. <unk>
yet another political scandal is <unk> japan
but this time it 's <unk> opposition as well as <unk> members
and as it <unk> it 's <unk> some of the more <unk> and <unk> aspects of japanese society
already ruling liberal democratic party demands that opposition members <unk> under <unk> in parliament have <unk> one budget committee session and forced the committee to plan a special <unk> investigation at the end of the month
but the scandal itself is so <unk> that <unk> members are divided between those who want to pursue the matter in hope of <unk> the opposition and those who favor leaving well enough alone
the opposition can be the most hurt because everyone already figures the ldp is that kind of <unk> says <unk> <unk> former aide to ldp <unk> <unk> <unk> and now an independent analyst
but he adds we ca n't tell where it will go at all because we 're still in the middle of it
this time the scandal centers on donations made by the <unk> pachinko <unk> industry
pachinko a kind of <unk> is japan 's favorite form of legal <unk>
the donations so far appear to be small especially compared with the huge <unk> that changed hands in the <unk> co <unk> scandal that <unk> the ruling party last year
but the implications could be great
pachinko is slightly on the <unk> side often linked to the lower <unk> of japan 's <unk> and <unk> at the top of annual lists of tax <unk>
recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions and political donations may have been made with the intent to <unk>
also about N N of pachinko <unk> owners are korean many of whom maintain close ties with north or south korean residents ' organizations and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in japan
to many japanese pachinko is <unk> or <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> pachinko <unk> <unk> from the main streets and narrow <unk> of cities and <unk> across the country
<unk> pass hours watching the <unk> <unk> and <unk> to the metal <unk> <unk> as much to gamble as to get a little time to be <unk> alone with their <unk>
at N yen $ N for a handful of <unk> pachinko is a common <unk> and has been since it took <unk> as cheap entertainment in the years after world war ii
but the total of all those <unk> <unk> has created an industry with a reported annual income of N trillion yen almost $ N billion or nearly the size of japan 's <unk> automobile industry
and because the pachinko industry is <unk> at the top of annual lists for tax <unk> some observers estimate the real income could be as much as N trillion yen
if that money were being <unk> it could bring the government a badly needed several trillion yen
in N an attempt was made to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions
then in N a proposal to keep better track of income by selling <unk> cards for pachinko was <unk> in parliament
the proposal split the industry in two along the lines of national <unk> north <unk> oppose the plan while south <unk> japanese and <unk> accept it or are <unk>
in august a conservative weekly magazine reported that a pachinko industry organization <unk> money to japan socialist party members
the magazine alleged that in making the donations the pachinko industry may have been offering <unk> to win support in the battle against <unk> cards or it may have been <unk> money back and <unk> between the <unk> and the north korean residents ' organization the chosen <unk>
the chosen <unk> and the <unk> immediately denied the report
and at first neither the opposition nor the ldp wanted to pursue the issue
but the press kept it alive as with the <unk> scandal lists began <unk> with names of people who had received money
within a matter of weeks <unk> magazines reported that members of the ruling ldp had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations
so far though there have been no allegations that the contributions the ldp members received <unk> to <unk>
then the two <unk> <unk> the <unk> reports that chosen <unk> had <unk> directly to <unk> members were rapidly <unk> by statements that the south korean residents ' organization had long been <unk> directly to ldp members
the <unk> admitted oct. N that its members received about eight million yen from the pachinko organization and charged ldp members with <unk> N million yen $ N and other opposition parties with taking about N million yen
on friday the chief <unk> secretary announced that eight <unk> ministers had received five million yen from the industry including N yen $ N by prime minister <unk> <unk>
no one has alleged that the donations were by themselves illegal
direct donations from either of the residents ' organizations would be illegal because the groups are defined as foreign but both groups deny making direct donations
they say it s possible some of their members may be <unk> privately
the issue is further complicated because although the organizations represent korean residents those residents were largely born and raised in japan and many speak only japanese
that they retain korean <unk> and ties is a <unk> of history their parents were <unk> in as <unk> during the decades when japan <unk> korea before world war ii and the discrimination that still faces <unk> in japanese society
many japanese think it only natural that the organizations or their members would <unk> to politicians the way many japanese do to win favor or support
both residents ' organizations <unk> to <unk> some funding from abroad
but ldp members and supporters of the <unk> <unk> idea tend to speak in <unk> about the <unk> 's alleged donations <unk> that north korean money would be more suspect than south korean because north korea is communist and south korea is an <unk>
when robert mcduffie was N he got a chance to play in the starting <unk> for his high school <unk> team in <unk> <unk>
unfortunately his mother had <unk> for a <unk> by <unk> <unk> the same night and she was <unk> about his <unk>
i <unk> such a fit says mr. mcduffie who had begun violin studies at the age of six
but once <unk> started playing i did n't give a <unk> about <unk>
<unk> i went home and <unk> for three hours
today it 's obvious that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> made the right choice
at N mr. mcduffie has a rich <unk> tone an <unk> <unk> <unk> and an increasingly busy schedule
he 's currently in the <unk> of a <unk> u.s. <unk> with <unk> <unk> and the warsaw <unk> with <unk> including <unk> <unk> oct. N <unk> <unk> oct. N <unk> <unk> oct. N and miami oct. N
later this season he gives a <unk> at washington 's kennedy center and appears as <unk> with several major <unk>
yet mr. mcduffie 's career has developed at a slower pace than those of some of his better known <unk>
during the late 1970s he was part of a <unk> <unk> <unk> a group of <unk> <unk> who <unk> at the <unk> school with the noted <unk> <unk> delay
his violin <unk> included <unk> <unk> a <unk> of <unk> <unk> who performed with major <unk> while still a student <unk> lin who joined the <unk> of <unk> artists inc. at the age of N and <unk> <unk> who launched her career by winning the N <unk> competition
i thought i was over the hill at N recalls mr. mcduffie an <unk> man with <unk> blue eyes and a light southern <unk>
but i was n't ready for a career at that time
young mcduffie 's first violin <unk> was <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> who <unk> in the <unk> public school system
he <unk> me how to play like a <unk> <unk> the <unk>
i did n't learn to <unk> until i got to <unk>
after studies at that <unk> 's <unk> division with an assistant to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> he <unk> at the college level to miss delay mr. <unk> 's longtime assistant and ultimately his rival
i think i had to prove <unk> to her says mr. mcduffie
but she was always encouraging
she only put her foot down twice he continues
in my <unk> year my <unk> was known as a party <unk>
she thought i was n't getting my <unk> done
as the <unk> tells it his <unk> looking <unk> put her hands on her <unk> <unk> her foot and said you 've just got to get the <unk> <unk> out of there
the second <unk> took place after mr. mcduffie gave an ambitious student <unk> and was feeling rather pleased with himself
miss delay requested that he come to her studio with a tape of the <unk>
we <unk> to the <unk> <unk> he recalls and she said you hear the first note that <unk>
that 's the only note that 's truly in <unk>
that 's the most important experience i 've had with any <unk> he says because she <unk> me how to listen
now when i play with <unk> the <unk> often <unk> me on my <unk>
it was also at <unk> that mr. mcduffie discovered his <unk> for conservative <unk> american <unk> such as david diamond and samuel <unk>
after winning a school competition with a performance of the <unk> 's violin <unk> mr. mcduffie was <unk> to play the work for the <unk> who was <unk> of cancer
<unk> was <unk> by the <unk> looking very <unk> recalls the <unk> who performed the work with a <unk> <unk> at the <unk> 's apartment
he did n't say much but what he said was important because it 's not in the <unk>
there 's a <unk> <unk> <unk> he 'd kill me if he heard me say that throughout the first movement
the only time the violin has it is right at the end
it 's written <unk> in the <unk> and i played it that way kind of <unk>
and he <unk> out <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
so we did it over he adds
i played very <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk>
if a <unk> is sensitive enough to bring down the <unk> volume at that point it makes the piece <unk>
i do n't know why <unk> never told anybody else
on <unk> <unk> 's <unk> it 's very <unk>
since leaving <unk> mr. mcduffie has made some <unk> moves and some controversial ones
his <unk> <unk> on the nbc <unk> <unk> another world <unk> <unk> <unk>
by contrast he 's won <unk> for his <unk> of william <unk> 's violin <unk> which he recently recorded for <unk> along with <unk> <unk> 's <unk> <unk> for violin <unk> <unk> and <unk>
mr. mcduffie 's <unk> tone <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> make him an <unk> <unk> of both works
aided by the <unk> playing of the st. louis <unk> under <unk> <unk> 's direction this <unk> really swings
mr. <unk> 's violin <unk> which sounds more like a <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> violin with <unk> <unk> <unk> until the <unk> <unk> <unk>
but there are <unk> <unk> in its <unk> slow <unk> and <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> and <unk>
at <unk> <unk> hall here mr. mcduffie was heard recently with mr. <unk> and the warsaw <unk> in more conventional fare <unk> 's <unk> violin <unk> in <unk> minor
his performance was so <unk> and driven that the <unk> rarely <unk>
the <unk> <unk> played <unk> with a big <unk> sound that <unk> its size
whatever he plays mr. mcduffie finds <unk> in the music itself something greater out there than me as he puts it during an interview at the manhattan apartment he shares with wife <unk> a <unk> <unk>
a normal person did not write the <unk> violin <unk> he <unk>
even when i hear it played badly i 'm still <unk> by the piece
if i could ever feel i 've contributed to it in some way then all the hard work has been worth it
ms. <unk> is a <unk> music writer in new york
are consumers too deep in <unk>
a lot of observers think so and if they 're right the whole economy as well as the <unk> among us could be hurt
a sudden forced <unk> by consumers who normally account for about two-thirds of economic activity would <unk> the economy at a time when <unk> spending is slowing and <unk> governments ca n't <unk> take up the <unk>
and another wave of bad loans would further <unk> many <unk> lending institutions
the <unk> <unk> some <unk> trends
during the almost <unk> economic expansion <unk> gross national product <unk> personal income and personal consumption expenditures have risen N N but <unk> consumer <unk> credit has surged N N
and the ratio of <unk> debt to <unk> personal income personal income after taxes has hit a high of about N N N
however these figures do n't seem to worry thomas a. <unk> an economist at the federal reserve board
in a paper presented at the recent annual meeting of the national association of business economists in san francisco mr. <unk> comments that <unk> credit always grows rapidly in cyclical advances and growth in this cycle is very typical of earlier <unk>
he adds we are now <unk> a slowdown which if history is a guide could <unk> for a while
but what about the debt burden
mr. <unk> <unk> that there is some <unk> level at which the ratio of <unk> debt to <unk> income indicates economic problems
and more <unk> he says the debt burden measured other ways is not really in <unk> <unk>
the <unk> below shows why see <unk> <unk> <unk> oct. N N
the ratio of consumer <unk> credit to <unk> income though up a bit has n't climbed <unk> and such debt as a percent of household assets is little changed
moreover the burden of consumer credit payments relative to <unk> income may be lower in this cycle than earlier mr. <unk> says
he notes that some <unk> credit-card credit is actually <unk> credit being used simply as a <unk> way of paying bills rather than a <unk> way of borrowing
in addition he says longer <unk> on automobile and other forms of <unk> credit boost the stock of debt faster than the flow of <unk> and the <unk> payment burden
and if you consider the changing distribution of credit mr. <unk> says much of the increase in debt in recent years is due to increasing credit use by <unk> families that is those probably best able to handle it
citing figures on <unk> loans he notes that N N of homeowners had <unk> credit accounts but the <unk> rises to N N of homeowners in the $ <unk> income range and N N of homeowners with income above $ N
and much <unk> credit is used <unk>
the most <unk> use is home improvement which <unk> <unk> the value of the property mr. <unk> says
so it is n't surprising that <unk> <unk> at banks remain as the <unk> shows <unk> below some earlier <unk> see <unk> <unk> <unk> oct. N N
a severe recession could of course raise <unk> rates but so far the current levels of consumer debt do n't seem to <unk> as a major threat
in fact the current weakness in auto buying and <unk> sales and the <unk> <unk> in the household <unk> rate suggest that consumers conservative as ever are already <unk> their <unk> a bit more <unk>
in july consumer <unk> credit outstanding fell for the first time since january N
consumers appear <unk> to add to their <unk> to support their spending <unk> <unk> a merrill lynch economist says
as a result household debt appears to be <unk> at around N N of gnp
consumers credit cards in hand are n't running <unk> through the shopping <unk> or putting the economy at any great risk

other major players in intimate apparel apparently feel the same way

it was then split into <unk> apparel inc. the intimate apparel division and <unk> family products corp. which makes <unk> <unk> items and other products

china could <unk> its foreign-exchange reserves as early as next year a western government report says unless imports are cut <unk> to help narrow the <unk> deficit
according to the report completed last month if china 's trade gap continues to <unk> at the pace seen in the first seven months of this year the reserves would be <unk> out either in N or N
a country is considered financially healthy if its reserves cover three months of its imports
the $ N billion of reserves china had in june would cover just that much
the report by the western government which declines to be identified <unk> that a <unk> foreign-exchange payment problem can be avoided only if import growth <unk> to below N N per <unk>
according to chinese <unk> figures import growth has slowed in recent months dropping to N N in july and N N in august from the year-earlier periods compared with an average growth rate of N N in the first half
but before import growth slowed china 's buying <unk> in the first half already had taken its toll on foreign-exchange reserves
the $ N billion level in june marked a drop from $ N billion at the end of april
china 's last big import <unk> sent reserves <unk> to $ N billion in june N from $ N billion the previous september
china might <unk> off a crisis if it acts as <unk> as it did to arrest the N decline when beijing <unk> the <unk> on foreign-exchange spending and <unk> the currency
but this time china faces a more difficult battle because of economic forces that have come into play since the <unk> square <unk> june N
for example china 's <unk> income is expected to suffer from the big drop in tourist <unk> since june N
revenue from <unk> this year is projected to total $ N billion down from $ N billion last year
because of this and the huge trade gap the deficit in china 's current account which measures trade in goods and services plus certain <unk> <unk> of funds is expected to <unk> sharply from the $ N billion deficit last year
the western government report suggests a number of <unk> for china 's <unk> balance two of which are considered most likely
in one imports and exports continue to grow at the <unk> average rates of N N and N N recorded during the first seven months and the <unk> deficit <unk> to $ N billion
in N china had a record deficit of $ N billion
the other scenario <unk> that beijing takes effective actions to curb imports in the coming months
in this case china would still <unk> the year with a <unk> deficit of $ N billion based on projections that imports for all of this year grow N N and exports N N
if china were still on good terms with foreign lenders it might be able to stem the <unk> on its foreign-exchange reserves by using some loan funds to offset the <unk> deficit
but since june foreign bankers led by international financial institutions have virtually suspended their new loans to china
even if borrowing <unk> commercial bankers are n't expected to lend as much as before
in addition economists are <unk> a slowdown in foreign direct investments as <unk> become increasingly wary of china 's <unk> political and economic environment
on top of all this <unk> <unk> are expected to peak in N to N
with less capital coming in china 's balance of payments would suffer
the western government report 's first scenario <unk> a N N reduction in foreign borrowing and a N N <unk> in foreign direct investment
in the second foreign borrowing is projected to grow N N and investment to drop N N
but in either case the report says china 's balance of payments would rapidly <unk> up foreign reserves which are used to finance the <unk>
in the first scenario the reserves would be <unk> next year and in the second they would be <unk> out in N
<unk> holding ag parent of the swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group said its group sales rose N N in the first nine months of the year to N billion francs $ N billion

ralph brown was N feet over minnesota when both <unk> on his <unk> N <unk> out
at N feet he says he and his <unk> were looking for an interstate or a <unk> to land
at N feet the engines <unk>
but <unk> that <unk> would probably ground him for repairs mr. brown <unk> his stop in nearby chicago and set course to get his load a few hundred <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> on time
had he been a little less <unk> i 'd have gotten the thing on the ground and headed for the <unk> bar mr. brown says
but he <unk> for federal express corp. perhaps the <unk> thing in corporate america to the green <unk>
federal 's employees work long hours and seem to <unk> on the stress of <unk> the <unk>
like mr. brown they sometimes go to surprising <unk> to meet that <unk> corporate goal <unk> the goods on time
they are a <unk> to federal 's management which since the company 's <unk> N years ago has had its way with its work force an unusual <unk> in the <unk> transportation industry
that may soon change
this month federal 's N pilots including some N acquired along with tiger international inc. in february will decide whether to <unk> the powerful air line pilots association as their <unk> agent
the election which would bring the first major union to federal 's u.s. operations has <unk> new <unk> against <unk> veterans such as mr. brown
it has also <unk> federal 's strongly <unk> management which is already <unk> with <unk> <unk> operations and with falling profits
a union <unk> or later has to have an <unk> and it has to have a victory <unk> w. smith federal 's chairman and chief executive says with <unk>
in our formula we do n't have any losers except the competition
what managers really fear is that the <unk> movement could spread beyond the pilots
under federal transportation law a government <unk> is attempting to <unk> the <unk> of tiger 's job <unk> into federal 's
depending on the outcome the merged company may face union elections this fall among <unk> <unk> <unk> workers stock <unk> and flight <unk>
these groups <unk> up to N N of its work force
unions would have a <unk> effect on the whole culture of the company says bernard la <unk> a professor at ohio state university at <unk> and a federal consultant
that culture carefully <unk> by mr. smith leaves little if any room for unions
since <unk> the company the <unk> vietnam <unk> who is still only N years old has <unk> an <unk> of <unk>
flights are <unk>
mr. smith 's managers have at times been called <unk> <unk> <unk> 's <unk>
the <unk> <unk> award the navy <unk> for a job well done is <unk> on federal 's workers who <unk> the call of duty
competitors are known as the <unk>
to <unk> employees ' <unk> mr. smith pays well
he also <unk> workers <unk> <unk> through an elaborate <unk> <unk> and as a <unk> fly free in <unk> <unk> seats
he gives <unk> talks in <unk> family <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> the company 's own television network
and with many of his N workers mr. smith 's <unk> attitude has caught on
james cleveland a <unk> who earned a <unk> <unk> for <unk> out how to get a major customer 's <unk> load to its <unk> by N a.m. <unk> himself far more than a <unk>
we do n't just hand the customer the package
that 's just the beginning he says
in <unk> we run the show
david <unk> a longtime pilot <unk> at the <unk> <unk> that a union might <unk> with his flight schedule
this is america he says
nobody has the right to tell me how much i can work
such <unk> have given federal flexibility not only to rapidly <unk> new technology but to keep its work force <unk> <unk>
the company <unk> <unk> <unk> employees ' <unk> to the limit
but though <unk> work as many as N hours a week during the <unk> <unk> they leave early during <unk> times while still being <unk> of a minimum <unk>
pilots as well <unk> fly <unk> to ensure that none are <unk> during seasonal <unk>
the operational freedom has also given federal a <unk> up on <unk> united <unk> service inc. the nation 's largest <unk> of united <unk> of <unk> members
<unk> wo n't discuss its labor practices but according to mr. cleveland a former <unk> employee and others union work rules <unk> <unk> drivers from doing more than carrying packages between customers and their <unk>
because <unk> drivers are n't permitted to load their own vehicles at the <unk> say these <unk> packages often get <unk> in the load and are delivered late
labor problems are the last thing mr. smith needs right now
although the tiger acquisition has brought federal a long way toward becoming the global player it wants to be it also has brought problems
it more than doubled federal 's long-term debt to $ N billion <unk> the company into <unk> <unk> heavy cargo and suddenly expanded its landing rights to N countries from four
federal on its own had n't been doing very well overseas
it had <unk> in its attempt to get into asia where treaty restrictions forced it to fly some planes <unk> on certain routes
on routes to south america the company had no <unk> <unk> to ensure delivery when planes were <unk>
in europe business suffered as federal bought several local companies only to have the managers <unk>
these and other problems squeezed federal 's profit margins last year to N N down from more than N N annually in the first half of the decade
earnings have plummeted too in each of the past three quarters
in the fiscal first period ended aug. N profit fell N N to $ N million or N cents a share mostly because of the tiger merger federal says
federal 's stock price however has held up well driven in part by the general <unk> of airline stocks analysts say
since trading as low as $ N a share in may federal 's shares have rallied as high as $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading
they closed friday at $ N down N cents on the day
there 's a certain <unk> in the fact that federal express faces its first union problems as a result of its tiger purchase
tiger itself was founded by a band of <unk> <unk> who had <unk> supplies over the <unk> from india to china during world war ii
in the early 1970s mr. smith <unk> his <unk> company on tiger 's <unk> of <unk> and <unk> operations
but from early on tiger 's workers <unk> while federal 's never have
federal express officials <unk> <unk> in their drive overseas but say it will pay off eventually
analysts expect federal 's earnings to improve again in its fiscal third quarter ending <unk> N when the company should begin <unk> from tiger 's extra flights <unk> planes and landing rights
until then they expect the cost of <unk> the two carriers to continue <unk> profits
for now the union issue is the most <unk> of federal 's tiger problems management believes
although encouraging <unk> between managers and workers mr. smith does n't <unk> what he <unk> <unk>
when a large group of pilots once signed <unk> <unk> <unk> and compensation changes he called a meeting in a company <unk> and <unk> them down for <unk> his authority
he then made most of the changes pilots say
that sort of approach however has n't worked since the addition of tiger
its N workers who had <unk> tiger 's management for years over <unk> were union members until the day of the merger when most of their unions were automatically <unk>
soon after the merger moreover federal 's management asked tiger 's pilots to sign an agreement <unk> that they could be fired any time without cause or notice
when the pilots refused the company <unk> it
mr. smith <unk> federal 's pilots too
in his <unk> to <unk> the deal with tiger chairman <unk> <unk> last august mr. smith ignored a promise that he had made to his own pilots three years ago that any <unk> acquired in future mergers would be <unk> put at the bottom of the pilot <unk> list that <unk> work <unk> pay and career options
the tiger merger agreement <unk> that the lists be combined on the basis of <unk>
mr. smith is trying hard to <unk> the <unk>
and even some <unk> pilots say his <unk> and <unk> among the many former military <unk> could be tough to beat
a lot of people are <unk> a vote for <unk> as a vote against <unk> smith says <unk> <unk> a <unk> pilot and union <unk>
mr. smith and other top federal executives have met with tiger workers in los angeles ohio new york <unk> asia and europe
recently they have appeared every few weeks in <unk> type <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
in one video mr. smith <unk> his agreement to merge the <unk> lists
he said mr. <unk> had <unk> that the merger talks move quickly
regulators as well might have <unk> the deal if tiger 's pilots had n't been protected he said
<unk> mr. smith added our contract with our pilots says that we will manage our fleet operations with their advice
it does n't give any particular group the ability to veto change
already the fight has been costly
the <unk> controversy along with the <unk> dispute has been turned over to the <unk>
meanwhile the company is operating with two separate pilot groups and <unk> lists and that is <unk> federal a big number says james <unk> executive vice president and chief operating officer
the issue has also cost federal management a lot of good will among its old pilots
they were willing to <unk> us because we had n't shown any <unk> any resistance says william <unk> a <unk> pilot and <unk> federal veteran
adds john <unk> a N <unk> and past chairman of the <unk> flight advisory board they 've made all these <unk> <unk> to the flying tiger pilots and for us nothing
such <unk> could prove <unk> in the union vote
a large majority of the N former tiger <unk> support the union according to a union study
but though most of the N federal pilots are believed opposed it is <unk> just how much their loyalty to mr. smith has been <unk>
the fight has turned <unk> and among pilots at least has <unk> the <unk> de <unk> that mr. smith worked so hard to build
<unk> pilots have held <unk> parties
some younger pilots say they have had to <unk> <unk> <unk> by senior pilots while flying across the country
and for now at least the competition is n't the only <unk>
barney <unk> a N <unk> and leader of the <unk> forces said he has received two <unk> death <unk> and been <unk> to a fight with tire <unk> by a <unk>
the pilots are either for us or extremely against us he says with a <unk>

the senate convicted u.s. district judge <unk> hastings of florida of eight impeachment articles <unk> the <unk> judge from his $ <unk> <unk> job
mr. hastings 's case was particularly <unk> because it marked the first time a federal official was <unk> and <unk> from office on charges of which a jury had <unk> him
in N mr. hastings was found not guilty of <unk> a $ N <unk> in a case before him the central charge on which the senate convicted him
he was only the <unk> federal judge ever <unk> from office after an impeachment trial
with no floor debate the senate on friday voted N to <unk> mr. hastings of <unk> and <unk> to accept a <unk> five votes more than needed
conviction on any single impeachment article was enough to remove judge hastings from office
he was found not guilty of three charges involving <unk> that he had <unk> disclosed information about a sensitive government investigation
the senate did n't vote on six <unk> charges
although mr. hastings had been <unk> by a jury lawmakers handling the <unk> in congress had argued that the purpose of impeachment is n't to <unk> an individual
instead they argued that impeachment <unk> to protect public institutions from people who have <unk> their positions of trust <unk> of the outcome of prior criminal or civil cases
mr. hastings faced the senators and sat <unk> during the first two <unk> votes then quickly left the chamber
in an <unk> news conference on the capitol steps he <unk> the senators ' action
their opinion is <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> ' <unk> regarding impeachment mr. hastings said
for the future he said he would run for governor of florida
mr. hastings was appointed to the federal <unk> by president <unk> in N and was one of the few black federal judges in the country
while he <unk> the senate <unk> with his supporters during some of the impeachment trial most civil rights groups kept their <unk> from his case
following the impeachment conviction dr. <unk> <unk> executive director of the national association for the <unk> of <unk> people issued a <unk> statement warning that the hastings case could set a dangerous <unk> but adding we must <unk> the considered judgment of the senate
when last we left him fbi agent <unk> mancuso had <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> a washington political scandal and <unk> up some pretty good ratings numbers in the <unk> favorite son
what next for the <unk> fbi agent with the heart of gold
a spinoff series of course
there are plenty of worse <unk> for shows and most of them had already made the fall <unk>
a <unk> raising some <unk> <unk>
a <unk> mother raising some <unk> <unk> models
a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> suits <unk> as <unk> <unk>
in that <unk> robert <unk> 's <unk> performance as the <unk> even <unk> veteran agent seems a better franchise for a series than most
week by week on mancuso fbi nbc <unk> N <unk> <unk> he <unk> around the crime <unk> of the rich famous and powerful of the washington scene a loose <unk> on <unk> at the fbi
over the first few weeks mancuso fbi has <unk> straight from the <unk> which is either a <unk> <unk> at <unk> or a lack of <unk> or both
the opening show <unk> a secretary of defense <unk> accused of <unk> a la john tower
when his secretary is found <unk> dead in the <unk> 's pool mancuso is called in to <unk>
last week a young black <unk> claimed she had been <unk> by a white police officer a la <unk> <unk>
in this week 's show there 's an <unk> nuclear <unk> facility a la <unk> <unk>
along the way we 're introduced to the supporting cast a <unk> <unk> secretary <unk> <unk> her real name <unk> a <unk> young boss <unk> <unk> another <unk> <unk> who 's also an <unk> lawyer <unk> <unk> and a <unk> expert charles <unk>
if all of this seems a little <unk> it 's <unk> in part by some <unk> <unk> <unk>
the usual <unk> are found to be guilty then not guilty then guilty but of a different crime
in last week 's rape case for example the <unk> turns out to have been a <unk> of incest and the biggest <unk> are the politicians who <unk> the case
most of all though the show is <unk> by the character of mancuso
what makes the veteran fbi man so <unk> is his <unk> <unk> earned we <unk> when he was assigned to the civil rights movement back in the <unk>
he was n't <unk> the freedom <unk> he was <unk> them as <unk>
this is not the <unk> <unk> scenario that <unk> his young colleagues <unk> you 've been reading classic <unk> too long mancuso says
back in N the fbi had five black agents
three were <unk> for j. <unk> <unk> and two <unk> his house
at the core of mr. <unk> 's mancuso is his <unk> <unk>
he describes a reporter as miss first amendment
he describes a <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk>
and when he 's told try a little <unk> he <unk> back i 'm going home to try a little <unk>
yet for all his <unk> he 's at heart a <unk> <unk> a <unk> with a secret <unk> on truth justice and the american way
he 's the kind of guy who <unk> <unk> <unk>
if mancuso fbi has an <unk> central character it also has a major <unk>
it 's <unk> <unk>
executive producers steve <unk> and jeff <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and steve <unk> have <unk> this show up to the breaking point
to start there 's always a crisis and someone always <unk> what if the press gets a hold of this
at least once an <unk> we see <unk> <unk> around <unk> <unk>
at least once mancuso 's boss <unk> in here now and proceeds to <unk> his <unk> down
you are a <unk> a <unk> in a $ N suit
one more word and you are out on a park <unk> <unk>
finally of course the boss gives in but he 's still <unk> i find <unk> <unk> anything to teddy kennedy you 'll be <unk> <unk> cars in <unk>
in fact throughout mancuso fbi we do n't get words or lines we get <unk>
witnesses <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> that the planet could be <unk> from itself and from the <unk> <unk> <unk> who try to <unk> down every <unk> man who raises his voice
and mancuso himself is investigating at the top of his <unk> how the <unk> can you live with <unk> he <unk> at a <unk>
you <unk> people 's trust
you built your career on <unk> and <unk>
the <unk> will be here years after the polls close
in each show mancuso gets to <unk> similar <unk>
where the <unk> are they <unk> <unk> live when people like you turn the world into a big <unk> waste <unk>
you 're the real criminal here and what you did was n't just a <unk> it was a crime against <unk>
and at least once a show someone <unk> the line get off that <unk>
now that 's advice the writers should take to heart
they have a series with a good character some interesting even occasionally surprising <unk> lines and they 're <unk> it
why when a key witness <unk> does mancuso <unk> her apartment <unk> down <unk> <unk> walls
it 's a <unk> and totally <unk> reaction all to add more <unk> to a <unk> that 's already <unk> on <unk>
that 's not <unk>
that 's not character
that 's <unk>
there is a scene at the end of the first week 's show where mancuso <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> to his dead partner david
asked to say a few words he <unk> out his <unk> piece of paper and tries to talk but he 's too <unk> up to get the words out
he <unk> on the piece of paper in <unk> then turns and <unk> away
it was a <unk> moving moment for series television and robert <unk> 's acting <unk> in the <unk>
there 's a pretty good program inside all the <unk> of mancuso fbi
if the show 's <unk> could just let themselves be quiet for a little they might just hear it
with a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> with <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> types with <unk> in their <unk> have a goal in common all of them try to put the right spin on it

texaco inc. has purchased an <unk> company in texas for $ N million its first major acquisition since its legal <unk> with <unk> co. began more than four years ago
the white <unk> n.y. oil company said friday that it had acquired <unk> production corp. a subsidiary of <unk> energy holdings inc. for $ N million in cash with the rest to be paid in shares of a new <unk> issue of preferred stock
<unk> which holds properties in N oil and gas fields in south texas will provide texaco with mostly gas reserves
the fields contain <unk> reserves of N billion <unk> feet of natural gas and four million barrels of oil
this acquisition is another indication of texaco 's commitment to increase the company 's reserve base said chief executive officer james w. <unk>
texaco has also been attempting to sell oil properties
at least two years ago the company put N million barrels of oil reserves on the block
they were either too small or <unk> to maintain the company said
not all of those <unk> have yet been sold
texaco acquired <unk> before it completed those sales because <unk> 's properties are high quality and near other fields texaco already owns a company spokeswoman said
texaco like many other oil companies has been struggling to replace its falling oil and gas reserves
texaco 's situation had become particularly complex because much of its effort had for years been <unk> on its <unk> with <unk> and then on new york investor <unk> c. icahn 's attempt to take over the company
<unk> had sued texaco for <unk> <unk> with its acquisition of a portion of <unk> oil co
eventually texaco which was forced into bankruptcy proceedings by that litigation settled its fight with <unk> for $ N billion in N
mr. icahn who played a key role in the settlement and attempted subsequently to take control of the company sold his stake in texaco just last summer
completion of texaco 's acquisition of <unk> is subject to government approval under the <unk> antitrust improvements act

<unk> ag 's chairman said the <unk> insurer is prepared to give up some of its independence to a white knight if necessary to <unk> a raider
amid heavy buying of shares in <unk> 's largest insurer <unk> <unk> also warned in an interview that a white knight in buying out a raider could leave speculators with big losses on their ag stock
since the beginning of the year the stock has nearly doubled giving ag a market value of about N billion <unk> francs $ N billion
the most likely white knight would be societe <unk> de <unk> s.a. which already owns N N of ag and which itself is controlled by <unk> <unk> de <unk> the <unk> french financial conglomerate
but mr. <unk> said a rescue also could involve <unk> mutual life insurance co. which owns N N of ag
ag is hardly alone in its anxiety
a <unk> <unk> is quickly <unk> europe 's <unk> insurance business
worried by european community <unk> that will remove many of the barriers to <unk> insurance services starting in <unk> insurers are <unk> to find partners and preparing for price wars
in west germany and the netherlands insurers are <unk> with banks
in france <unk> and <unk> assurances s.a. both have been on the <unk> for giant acquisitions <unk> last month acquired control of <unk> <unk> the <unk> european insurance company after a takeover battle with <unk> <unk>
mr. <unk> said the volume of shares changing hands has grown significantly since <unk>
but he estimated that a raider would have been able to <unk> no more than N N of the shares in recent months
aside from <unk> plans for joint ventures or acquisitions mr. <unk> has called top managers of companies <unk> as potential <unk> among them <unk> union <unk> assurances de paris and <unk> all based in france
they have all very clearly stated that they have not acquired and are not acquiring shares of ag he said
any raider would find it hard to crack ag 's <unk>
a syndicate of shareholders holds just under N N of ag mr. <unk> said and members have agreed to give one another the right of first <unk> should they sell any ag shares
aside from <unk> de <unk> and <unk> the syndicate includes <unk> <unk> a <unk> savings bank and various family interests
a <unk> spokesman confirmed that the giant <unk> holding company would be willing to raise its stake in ag should a raider seek control
<unk> officials could n't be reached for comment

with the <unk> <unk> from the failed coup attempt in panama one of the many <unk> questions the bush administration will <unk> is this is the national security council staff big enough and does it have enough <unk> to do its job of <unk> foreign policy
president bush 's national security adviser <unk> gen. <unk> <unk> came into office in january intent on making the nsc staff <unk> and more <unk> than it had been during the reagan administration
gen. <unk> was a member of the tower commission which <unk> the <unk> affair
he was all too aware of how a large <unk> <unk> nsc staff had <unk> out of control and nearly <unk> president reagan 's second term
so following both the style he <unk> as president ford 's national security adviser and the <unk> of the tower commission gen. <unk> has <unk> the nsc staff and tried to ensure that it <unk> to its assigned <unk> <unk> <unk> the views of the state department pentagon and intelligence community serving as an <unk> broker in <unk> that information for the president and then making sure presidential decisions are carried out
the tower commission specifically said that the nsc staff should be small and warned against letting <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> north strike out on their own rather than leaving the <unk> <unk> of policies to the state department pentagon or central intelligence agency
however the panama <unk> has raised questions about whether the nsc staff is <unk> big <unk> and powerful to <unk> u.s. policy on tough issues
during the coup attempt and its aftermath nsc <unk> were <unk> very thin says one senior administration official
it 's a very small shop
gen. <unk> does n't plan to increase the staff right now but is <unk> that possibility the official adds
the nsc staff does n't have the <unk> that i believe is required to have an effective <unk> process says frank <unk> a former pentagon aide who now runs the center for security policy a conservative washington <unk>
the problem with this administration i think is that by design it has greatly <unk> both in a <unk> sense and in a <unk> sense the role of the nsc
the national security council itself was established in N because policy makers <unk> a need in an increasingly complex world for a formal system within the white house to make sure that communications <unk> <unk> between the president and the state department pentagon and intelligence agencies
by law the council includes the president vice president and <unk> of state and defense
in practice the director of central intelligence and chairman of the joint <unk> of staff also serve as <unk> members
but the size shape and role of the nsc staff have been left for each president and his national security adviser to decide
that task is one of washington 's <unk> problems
in the bush white house the size of the nsc 's staff of professional officers is down to about N from about N in N administration officials say
administration officials insist that the size of the staff was n't a problem during the panama crisis
but one clear problem during the coup attempt was that the nsc <unk> most experienced in latin america <unk> <unk> was gone
he had just resigned at least in part because of a <unk> with assistant secretary of state bernard <unk> over the administration 's policy on panama and support for nicaragua 's contra rebels
the absence of mr. <unk> <unk> the possible <unk> of the current nsc staff
both gen. <unk> and his deputy robert <unk> are experts in <unk> affairs
gen. <unk> is particularly <unk> in arms control and mr. <unk> has spent years studying soviet politics and society
both have become <unk> of president bush

ford motor co. and <unk> ab of <unk> broke off talks about a possible alliance after ford officials concluded that the cost to <unk> saab 's car operations would <unk> the likely return
with the collapse of the talks friday european analysts expect ford to <unk> its pursuit of british luxury car maker jaguar plc which is <unk> to fend off a hostile ford bid by negotiating a friendly alliance with ford 's <unk> general motors corp
saab meanwhile is left to continue its search for an <unk> to shore up its <unk> car business
saab said last week it has had and will continue to have <unk> with other manufacturers
among the possible <unk> is italy 's fiat <unk> a analysts said last week
ford and saab officials declined to elaborate publicly on the announcement friday that their negotiations failed to yield an agreement that could make long-term business sense to both parties
individuals close to the ford side of the negotiations said late last week that the no. N u.s. auto maker lost interest as it became clear that the swedish auto maker 's automotive operations had little to offer in the way of image or technology
ford originally had seen a saab alliance as a way to expand its presence in the european and u.s. luxury car markets
in addition ford and saab had discussed a possible link between their heavy truck operations
but the talks on a heavy truck alliance apparently did n't go far
some european analysts <unk> that officials of saab 's highly profitable <unk> truck operation <unk> at <unk> any of their <unk>
meanwhile ford officials became convinced they could n't expect to recover the investment it would require to make saab 's cars competitive in the increasingly <unk> luxury market
saab 's problems were <unk> friday when the company announced that its car division had a N billion <unk> $ N million loss during the first eight months of this year slightly worse than <unk> had forecast in its <unk> report last month
overall <unk> 's pretax profit during the first eight months of the year plunged N N to N billion swedish <unk> $ N million from N billion <unk> $ N million a year earlier
industry analysts in europe said the most likely <unk> for saab now is fiat
saab and fiat have worked together in the past in one case developing jointly a new auto <unk> that became the foundation of saab 's N model fiat 's <unk> and <unk> 's <unk>
last month <unk> chief executive <unk> <unk> said his company has had talks with fiat about a broader alliance
but the talks <unk> nothing so advanced that we needed to make a public announcement about it he said
as for ford analysts expect the end of the saab play will allow the u.s. auto maker to focus its resources on the <unk> struggle with gm for a stake in jaguar
the failure of the saab talks makes it even more crucial for ford to be <unk> in the jaguar contest said stephen <unk> european auto industry analyst at <unk> & drew in london
ford faces an <unk> fight for jaguar however
jaguar executives said last week they expect to have a friendly alliance with gm <unk> up by the end of the month
gm meanwhile is <unk> a delegation of members of the british parliament who are <unk> the auto maker 's <unk> operations in <unk>
a gm spokesman said the visit is n't connected to the jaguar situation
but ford clearly views jaguar as a <unk> worth fighting for since the company 's <unk> brand image would give ford a badly needed <unk> up in the high end of the luxury markets in both europe and the u.s.
last week ford <unk> a setback in its effort to <unk> its u.s. luxury offerings when it was forced to <unk> a <unk> effort to market its <unk> <unk> <unk> in the u.s. as a luxury import under the merkur brand name
so despite the <unk> <unk> analysts say ford by last friday had boosted its jaguar holding to about N N of the luxury auto maker 's shares outstanding from N N early last week
about N million jaguar shares changed hands in active trading on london 's stock exchange friday and jaguar shares moved up N pence to N pence $ N

once fat and happy the cowboys now are losing games fans and money
last year the team ended up $ N million in the red on $ N million in revenue
it has some of the highest costs in the league
its <unk> is off N N from six years ago
at the very least mr. jones who <unk> the society circuit as <unk> as his <unk> can take <unk> in one fact these days he is n't alone
nearly half the owners of the N national football league <unk> are losing money the result of flat <unk> <unk> <unk> and more than anything <unk> salaries for star players like mr. <unk>
last year the top N players on each nfl team took home an average $ N a figure comparable to baseball and higher than in <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> have done even better average salaries and bonuses for them rose to $ N this year up N N from N
it 's a <unk> <unk> says art <unk> owner of the cleveland <unk>
one team pays so much and the other pays more
we just do n't have that kind of income <unk>
all this is causing <unk> in professional football
owners largely <unk> in the past are now almost <unk> looking for ways to lower costs and raise revenue <unk> some <unk> ideas in the process
though not <unk> the cowboys ' mr. jones has come to represent this new <unk> of owner
shortly after buying N N of the team from <unk> <unk> bright for $ N million and <unk> of the cowboys ' <unk> bottom line the <unk> mr. jones set about his own round of team cuts
first he <unk> <unk> tom <unk> the <unk> <unk> who took the cowboys to five <unk> <unk> and N consecutive winning <unk>
in dallas mr. <unk> has a standing just <unk> of <unk>
<unk> sentiment <unk> the local press a crude <unk> <unk> said one writer a real <unk> said another who in the <unk> does he think he is wrote a third
for mr. jones it was just the beginning
he quickly cut the team 's <unk> administrative staff by half shut down a <unk> <unk> academy and in july announced plans to sell valley <unk> the team 's <unk> practice <unk> and the most <unk> training facility in the nfl
mr. jones calls the <unk> the pentagon of <unk>
it is a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> film rooms elaborate <unk> and <unk> centers that <unk> to a <unk> more <unk> era
he <unk> to tell the <unk> of how he got lost on the <unk> <unk> during an early visit took <unk> in an office and called the front <unk> for help
i said somebody come get me
i 'm at <unk> N
with a new day <unk> on the sport mr. jones does n't see a place for this sort of luxury
it 's just not cost efficient he says
the place costs nearly $ N million a year to maintain
when he sells it he says the cowboys will move to a more practical read <unk> <unk> practice field near texas stadium
and as for tom <unk> well in mr. jones 's mind he had played out his winning years
after posting losing <unk> in each of the last three years the cowboys needed a change he says
football has long been mr. jones 's <unk> both on and off the field
an arkansas <unk> he started at guard on the <unk> N university of arkansas team that won a national <unk>
after college he worked at his father 's insurance company in little rock and in N led an <unk> attempt to buy the san diego <unk>
years later with cash from the sale of the insurance company he founded <unk> production corp. an oil and gas exploration company based in little rock
so it was n't surprising that mr. jones returned to his arkansas <unk> when he went looking for a replacement for mr. <unk>
he <unk> <unk> johnson a <unk> on the N university of arkansas <unk> and the head <unk> at the university of miami where he led the <unk> to five winning <unk> and a national <unk> in N
whatever mr. johnson 's <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> of many dallas fans he is no tom <unk>
seven games and after a loss to the kansas city <unk> yesterday seven losses into the season the new cowboys are n't doing any better than the old
in fact the last time they played this badly was in N their opening season
average <unk> at their games about N last year continues flat
mr. jones is <unk> the problem on several <unk>
he continues to <unk> the team trading <unk> running back <unk> <unk> to the minnesota <unk> this month for a <unk> of players and future <unk> <unk>
to try to draw more fans he has dropped <unk> ticket prices from $ N to $ N
but the general trend given rising costs in the league has been to raise prices and mr. jones is expected to eventually follow suit
it 's simple says <unk> hunt who owns the kansas city <unk> and last year raised ticket prices by $ N to an average $ N
if we did n't increase prices we 'd be in the red
mr. jones has also <unk> up his marketing staff to sell the N luxury <unk> <unk> texas stadium his deal with <unk> bright included operating rights for the stadium
the <unk> are <unk> have <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and offer a clear view of the field all for a sale price of $ N to $ N million depending on their size and location
mr. jones has been taking <unk> <unk> owners onto the field during practice to let them <unk> <unk> with players and promises those who actually buy one of the rooms an insider 's look at the team 's strategy before game time
the sales job seems to be paying off when he bought the team only six of the <unk> had been sold
today N have
gate receipts are only the cowboys ' second largest source of cash
the biggest is the nfl 's contract with national television for broadcast of the league 's games
last year the cowboys ' share of that <unk> came to $ N million
the team <unk> <unk> between $ N million and $ N million for local radio and television broadcast rights
mr. jones is currently trying to jack up the price for those local rights
he is also trying to get more stations in mexico where the cowboys have a following to pick up the games

details of the plan which would go into effect in N are <unk> but each player would apparently be paid a base salary <unk> to his position and ability
bonuses would be paid based on playing time and performance
the nfl players association meanwhile contends that <unk> are paid a wage <unk> with their ability to draw fans and that some owners are in financial trouble because of poor business management not players ' salaries
the owners are trying to boost profit in other ways too
many have launched promotions to attract new fans and are <unk> <unk> stadium contracts
most of the owners must pay up to N N of gross ticket sales for <unk> on <unk> they say are either too small or too old
in chicago for example size is the issue
we have the worst lease in the nfl contends michael b. <unk> the president of the chicago <unk> and a <unk> of george <unk> who founded the nfl 's <unk> organization
we 're in a <unk> area with millions of bear fans and only a small number can be <unk>
when the lease expires in N he says it 's got to be changed
this year the nfl also imposed an <unk> limit on <unk> going into training <unk> down from N in a move meant to <unk> payroll costs
and the league is trying to get more for its <unk> national network contract which expires after this season
the current contract pays the nfl $ N billion
owners say they expect the league to demand a N N increase despite the fact that <unk> football games have had lackluster ratings
an nfl spokesman also says the league will probably expand its offerings to cable tv companies like <unk>
the changes have n't come easy
like the game of professional football the nfl organization itself is in turmoil

if the request is approved by both the house and senate mr. <unk> would need only permission from the white house office of management and budget to move the money according to senate budget analysts
that would give the pentagon flexibility that no other federal agency has
it 's simply a way of making the cuts less <unk> for defense than they are for domestic programs said chairman james <unk> d. <unk> of the senate budget committee who said he would oppose the request
that is n't <unk> with the kind of discipline that <unk> is supposed to <unk> he said

despite levels of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> these projects all remain in my mind valuable and well worth the effort
there is a simple reason for this the cuban people
let me immediately put limits to whatever <unk> <unk> that may intimate
those people to whom i <unk> are not some <unk> <unk> <unk> they are artists critics <unk> drivers <unk> even some employees of the ministry of culture all of whom share a deep belief in the original <unk> of the cuban revolution <unk> out in terms such as <unk> among all members of the society <unk> for education and creative <unk> universal rights to health and <unk> housing <unk>

mr. <unk> should make <unk> among <unk> the army and the cuban people
they are not <unk> since they are <unk> to act based on their own circumstances
it is <unk> to <unk> a government 's policies with the will of the people as we well know and it is even worse <unk> to merge the clearly <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the military and the state <unk>
mr. <unk> is also <unk> that mr. <unk> has <unk> <unk> with u.s. officials even though by his own account that <unk> has been <unk> essentially as a <unk> for acts directly hostile to the cuban regime such as <unk> <unk>
i think it 's a little <unk> to be surprised that <unk> does n't <unk> the u.s. state department to <unk> the <unk> of the cuban government over its own <unk>
we badly need to follow fact rather than the <unk> of conventional <unk>
without this basic level of attention to reality our policies on cuba will continue to be as <unk> as they have for N years

mr. lloyd said both qintex entertainment and qintex australia had attempted to secure a loan that would allow the company to make the $ N million payment but the request was turned down by an <unk> <unk> on oct. N
at that point he said qintex australia stated it would <unk> to <unk> the financing
however a qintex australia spokesman said his firm had never promised or guaranteed to make the payment
in a prepared statement from australia the company also said that following the <unk> of the mgm talks it had been <unk> its position as a significant shareholder and a substantial <unk> of qintex entertainment and had resolved to <unk> the degree of further loans to qintex entertainment in excess of that previously made
the qintex australia spokesman added that his company had opposed the chapter N filing
he said the company believed qintex entertainment 's financial problems could have been resolved by other means
the report of the bankruptcy filing <unk> hollywood executives and investors
it 's a <unk> said joseph <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> capital securities a brokerage firm that has an investment in qintex entertainment
qintex australia was going to pay more than $ N billion for mgm\/ua and then they could n't come up with the far smaller sum of $ N million
qintex said mr. evans the former president resigned for personal reasons and that mr. <unk> an attorney resigned because his participation in <unk> the company 's role in buying mgm\/ua was no longer necessary
mr. <unk> was a director of the company and a <unk> firm since N
the announcement seemed to further <unk> prospects that talks between qintex australia and mgm\/ua might be <unk>
it 's understood that mgm\/ua recently <unk> <unk> <unk> 's news corp. which made two failed bids for the movie studio to see if the company was still interested
however we are n't currently doing anything
it is n't a current topic of <unk> at the company said <unk> <unk> chairman and chief executive officer of the fox inc. unit of news corp
financial <unk> <unk> & co. said it formed a business <unk> service which will provide legal financial and other services in most major <unk> including japanese chinese and russian
japan 's finance ministry strongly denied playing any role in the new york <unk> free fall
<unk> <unk> vice minister for international affairs said the ministry did n't in any way suggest to japanese banks that they stay out of the ual corp. leveraged buy-out
the ministry has never even suggested that japanese banks be cautious about leveraged buy-outs in general mr. <unk> said
there are no facts behind the <unk> that we sent any kind of signal he declared in an interview
the comments were the ministry 's first detailed public statement on the subject and reflect the ministry 's concern that <unk> will think japan is using its tremendous financial power to control events in foreign markets
a number of accounts of the events leading to the N point drop in new york stock prices on oct. N accused the ministry of <unk> the <unk> on the ual deal for one reason or another
mr. <unk> said the most the ministry had ever done was ask japanese banks about the status of their participation in one previous u.s. leveraged buy-out
the ministry <unk> about that deal which mr. <unk> declined to identify because the large presence of japanese banks in the deal was being strongly criticized in the u.s. congress and it was necessary for us to <unk> the situation
he said the inquiry was n't made in a way that the banks could have interpreted as either encouraging or <unk> participation and he added that none of the japanese banks changed their <unk> on the deal as a result of the inquiry
mr. <unk> also said some japanese banks were willing to participate in the ual financing up to the very end which would suggest at the very least that they were n't under orders to back out
in general mr. <unk> said japanese banks are becoming more independent in their approach to overseas deals
each japanese bank has its own judgment on the profits and risks in that ual deal he said
they are becoming more independent
it 's a sound phenomenon
<unk> bank ltd. is one japanese bank that decided not to participate in the first ual proposal
a <unk> bank spokesman denied that the finance ministry played any part in the bank 's decision
we made our own decision he said
still mr. <unk> may have a hard time <unk> market analysts who have <unk> or <unk> believed that the ministry played a role in <unk> recent moves by japanese banks
all week there has been much speculation in financial <unk> in tokyo and abroad about the ministry 's real position
bank analysts say ministry officials have been growing increasingly concerned during the past few months about japanese banks getting in over their heads
the ministry thinks the banks do n't know what they are doing that they have very little idea how to <unk> with risk said one foreign bank analyst who asked not to be identified
the ministry wants to see the japanese banks <unk> in their <unk> on leveraged buy-outs he added
although some of the japanese banks involved in the first proposed bid for ual <unk> out because they found the terms <unk> observers here say they have a hard time <unk> that commercial <unk> were the only reason
japanese banks are under political pressure as well the analyst said
moreover analysts point out that japanese banks have a reputation for doing deals that are n't extremely profitable if they offer the chance to build market share <unk> an important business relationship or <unk> favor with powerful bureaucrats
clearly some financial authorities are concerned about the japanese banks role in leveraged buy-outs
at a news conference this week bank of japan gov. <unk> <unk> <unk> banks to take a <unk> stance regarding highly leveraged deals
despite mr. <unk> 's statements it is the finance ministry not the central bank that makes policy decisions
while recent events may cool some of the leveraged buy-out <unk> japanese banks are n't likely to walk away from the game
despite the risks the deals can be an attractive way for japanese banks to increase their presence in the u.s. market bank analysts say
<unk> with cash at home but with fewer customers to lend to leading banks are eager to expand overseas
<unk> in on big deals is a high <unk> way to <unk> the problem of not having a strong <unk> network
france 's national tobacco company known for making <unk> cigarettes such as <unk> and <unk> is <unk> out
concerned by <unk> demand for its traditional products it is moving not only into <unk> cigarettes but also into electronic <unk> payment cards to be sold in neighborhood tobacco stores
brown tobacco in france is a more <unk> stronger <unk> than the <unk> <unk> or <unk> tobacco used in so-called <unk> cigarettes
we are n't philip morris cos. says <unk> de <unk> chairman of <unk> societe <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> & <unk> s.a. known as <unk>
he says that because <unk> 's profits are limited by <unk> cigarette prices he does n't have the cash to <unk> as heavily into food and <unk> as the u.s. concern has done
last year for example <unk> 's net profit soared N N to N million french francs $ N million on sales of <unk> N billion a N N profit margin
instead he said in an interview he is looking for ways to <unk> france 's network of N tobacco agents most of them <unk>
while <unk> does n't own the french <unk> its close alliance with them offers distribution <unk>
one proposal is to introduce a new payment system for parking in paris
instead of paying for parking by putting money in the existing machines which deliver little paper receipts drivers would be able to buy electronic cards in local tobacco shops
once <unk> the <unk> would sit in the car 's <unk> showing traffic <unk> how much time the <unk> could remain
when the <unk> returned to his car he could turn the <unk> off and if it showed time remaining save it for later
<unk> is a partner in the project which was developed by <unk> <unk> using japanese technology
<unk> and <unk> currently are negotiating with city officials for the right to begin service
and <unk> is considering further <unk>
it wanted to buy rjr nabisco inc. 's french <unk> subsidiary <unk> in hopes of selling its products in tobacco stores but lost the bidding to food group <unk> <unk>
it currently is considering bidding for swedish match co
and it <unk> an interest in acquiring <unk> and other articles that might be sold in tobacco shops
it also is trying to shore up its tobacco business
<unk> cigarettes such as <unk> now make up just N N of the french tobacco market half the level of about two decades ago
while <unk> <unk> a manufacturing <unk> in france it is being hurt by rising imports and from <unk> cigarette demand
so <unk> has introduced <unk> cigarettes under the <unk> <unk> and intends to <unk> the unsuccessful <unk> <unk> in new <unk> similar to the <unk> used by <unk> <unk>
the aim says mr. de <unk> is to win market share from imported cigarettes and to persuade <unk> who are <unk> to <unk> cigarettes to keep buying french
when the supreme court <unk> missouri 's abortion restrictions last july the <unk> almost certainly did n't have <unk> driving <unk> and false <unk> on their <unk>
but the N ruling may have had as much immediate impact on those activities especially <unk> as on abortion rights
the decision webster vs. <unk> health services <unk> how supreme court <unk> often have a <unk> effect <unk> into areas of law and policy that were n't part of the actual cases decided and that never were <unk> by the <unk>
in the missouri case <unk> consequences may have <unk> because the high court <unk> the <unk> of the state 's N abortion law
the <unk> says that human life begins at <unk> and that <unk> children have rights protected by the constitution
last year a federal appeals court in st. louis said the <unk> was <unk> citing an earlier supreme court ruling that states ca n't <unk> <unk> abortion <unk> by changing the definition of when life begins
but the supreme court concluded that it was <unk> to rule on the <unk> of the <unk> because the definition of human life had n't yet been used to restrict abortion services
the high court majority said it was up to the state courts for now to decide whether the definition has any <unk> on other state laws
already local missouri judges have <unk> on the restored <unk> in two separate cases to throw out criminal <unk> charges against anti-abortion <unk> who <unk> access to <unk> health services an abortion <unk> in st. louis
the <unk> said their actions were <unk> by the desire to save the lives of <unk> children
under a N missouri law <unk> accused of some <unk> including <unk> may offer a defense that their actions were <unk> as an emergency measure to avoid an <unk> public or private <unk>
<unk> on the <unk> 's statement that a <unk> is an <unk> child the two st. louis county circuit court judges in august accepted the <unk> that the abortion <unk> <unk> were trying to save lives
in another case a <unk> <unk> <unk> was convicted of <unk> before the supreme court 's webster ruling
last week when her appeal was argued before the missouri court of appeals her lawyer also <unk> on the <unk>
the effect of the supreme court webster opinion is that it left room for <unk> to grow in the <unk> of <unk> vs. <unk> and i think this is one of the <unk> said mark <unk> a st. louis lawyer who represented ms. <unk> and the other st. louis <unk>
<unk> vs. <unk> was the supreme court 's N decision that <unk> a woman 's right to abortion
<unk> <unk> president of kansas city lawyers for life says that if abortion <unk> succeed in using the <unk> to escape <unk> for <unk> this will shut down abortion in missouri
there 's no risk to the <unk> and you ca n't keep an abortion <unk> open if there are N people standing outside every day
that would be an <unk> result of a case in which the supreme court <unk> stopped short of <unk> <unk> vs. <unk>
in two other cases the possible consequences of the supreme court ruling appear even more <unk>
in one the lawyer for a <unk> <unk> of columbia <unk> who was charged with <unk> driving argued that his client should be <unk> as a <unk> <unk> because his actual age should be calculated from <unk> not from <unk>
in missouri those caught <unk> and driving between the <unk> of N and N may have their licenses <unk> for one year while those N or older suffer only a <unk> suspension
a <unk> county judge rejected the motion but daniel <unk> a <unk> city lawyer says he has appealed
and in a case filed in federal court in august a lawyer is <unk> that missouri authorities are <unk> <unk> the <unk> of a pregnant woman who is in jail for <unk> and <unk>
in terms of <unk> <unk> the <unk> regime of <unk> barre may <unk> as no. N in the world
the only reason that <unk> remains in <unk> is numbers a <unk> <unk> <unk> of N million people spread out over an <unk> nearly the size of texas
the barre <unk> simply is limited in the amount of people it can <unk> and kill
<unk> small children <unk> elderly people to death <unk> and <unk> women and <unk> people alive are just a few of the <unk> activities that the <unk> <unk> forces have been engaged in over the past two years
up to N <unk> have <unk> to the relative safety of <unk> <unk> because of the behavior of president barre 's troops
in the <unk> of <unk> for example hundreds of men of the rival <unk> <unk> were <unk> up in may N <unk> and then taken out at night in groups of five to N men to be <unk> without any judicial process <unk>
<unk> were never used each man was <unk> to death with a large <unk>
the <unk> details are only now emerging from a <unk> <unk> report based on hundreds of <unk> with <unk> selected <unk>
the study was done by robert <unk> a consultant to the u.s. state department who has years of experience in investigating <unk> <unk> on both sides of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
what gives these events particular <unk> however is the fact that they are part of a wider <unk> affecting the strategic positions of both the u.s. and the soviet union on the <unk> of africa
not since the late 1970s has the <unk> been so up for <unk> as it has suddenly become in just the past few weeks
mr. barre 's rule is <unk> fast
<unk> <unk> his <unk> forces really just an <unk> <unk> which control less than half the country
inflation is at record levels
<unk> he has called in the <unk> to help fight the rebels of the <unk> national movement in the north which is only one of several groups <unk> away at the regime in the capital of <unk>
<unk> years old and a <unk> scientific socialist president barre has a power base <unk> only of his minority <unk> <unk> that according to observers is <unk>
the u.s. 's interest in <unk> <unk> of a single <unk> at the <unk> of <unk> which u.s. military aircraft have the right to use for <unk> of the gulf of <unk> and the indian ocean
that strip of concrete is backed up by a few <unk> <unk> <unk> where a handful of american <unk> <unk> by imported food cold soft <unk> and back issues of sports <unk> maintain radio <unk> with the outside world
in the past two years the desert behind them has become a land of mass <unk> and <unk> <unk> where due to mr. barre 's <unk> and <unk> nobody is any longer in control
as long as the rival <unk> regime of <unk> <unk> <unk> held a total <unk> over <unk> <unk> the u.s. was forced to accept that <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk> no. N to the soviets ' <unk> of <unk> next door
but due to dramatic events on the <unk> over the past few days and weeks those soviet <unk> may soon be as <unk> and as <unk> as the american <unk>
on sept. N i wrote on these pages about the <unk> and <unk> of N <unk> <unk> by <unk> and <unk> <unk>
recently in <unk> <unk> in the center of <unk> <unk> forces have killed <unk> and <unk> an additional N government troops
think what these numbers mean considering the <unk> space <unk> to hundreds of deaths in lebanon a small country of little strategic importance
<unk> <unk> are now N miles north of <unk> <unk> threatening the town of <unk> which would cut off mr. <unk> 's capital from the <unk> of <unk> through which all fuel and other supplies reach <unk> <unk>
as a result mr. <unk> has been forced to transfer thousands of troops from <unk> just to hold the town <unk> <unk> the loss of even more <unk> in <unk> only to keep the <unk> at bay
mr. <unk> is in an increasingly weak position half his army is tied down <unk> the northern city of <unk> from the <unk>
the weaker he gets the more he turns toward the u.s. for help
while the <unk> are communists like the <unk> they are among the most <unk> <unk> in the world having suffered more than a decade of <unk> <unk> by the <unk> <unk> air force
what this all means in <unk> is that soviet <unk> in <unk> is <unk> as fast as president barre 's regime in <unk> is
the u.s. therefore has a <unk> opportunity both to strike a blow for human rights in <unk> and to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the late 1970s on the <unk> of africa
back to <unk>
the state department to its credit has already begun <unk> itself from mr. barre <unk> by its decision to publish the <unk> report which the press has ignored
what 's more the u.s. has suspended $ N million in military aid and $ N million in economic aid
but this is not enough
because the u.s. is still perceived to be tied to mr. barre when he goes the <unk> could go too
considering how <unk> the security of that <unk> is anyway the better option both <unk> and <unk> would be for the bush administration to <unk> the regime publicly in terms clear enough for all <unk> <unk> to understand
it is a <unk> that mr. barre 's days are <unk>
the u.s. should take care however that its own position in the country does not go down with him
nobody is sure what will come next in <unk> or whom the successor might be
but as one expert tells me <unk> it is will have to work pretty <unk> hard to be worse than barre
while the state department positions itself for the <unk> period in <unk> it should continue to back former president <unk> 's <unk> role as a <unk> between mr. <unk> and the <unk> <unk> in <unk> while <unk> opening up <unk> of communications with the <unk> rebels through <unk> <unk>
<unk> politics are the most sophisticated <unk> and <unk> in all of black africa
remember that it took mr. <unk> many months in what became known as the <unk> coup to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in N and N
there is simply no way to <unk> a <unk> <unk> as is sometimes possible elsewhere on the <unk>
but the u.s. has one great advantage the soviets are <unk> <unk> throughout <unk> for what they did to the country this past decade <unk> and all
it 's not just in eastern europe where the march of events is finally on the u.s. side but on the <unk> of africa as well
the only u.s. liability in the region is what remains of the link to mr. barre and that should be cut fast
mr. <unk> author of <unk> or <unk> the wars behind the <unk> <unk> press N lives in <unk>
<unk> inc. <unk> <unk> calif. got an $ N million navy contract for <unk> systems
general electric co. received a $ N million air force contract for <unk> <unk> <unk>
goodyear tire & <unk> co. was awarded a $ N million army contract for <unk> parts

opec 's ability to produce more petroleum than it can sell is beginning to cast a shadow over world oil markets
output from the organization of petroleum <unk> countries is already at a high for the year and most member nations are running flat out
but industry and opec officials agree that a handful of members still have enough <unk> capacity to <unk> the market and cause an <unk> collapse a few months from now if opec does n't soon <unk> a new <unk> system to <unk> its <unk> <unk>
as a result the effort by some oil ministers to get opec to approve a new permanent <unk> agreement next month is taking on increasing <unk>
the organization is scheduled to meet in <unk> beginning nov. N
so far this year rising demand for opec oil and production <unk> by some members have kept prices firm despite <unk> <unk> by others
but that could change if demand for opec 's oil <unk> seasonally early next year as some think may happen
opec is currently producing more than N million barrels a day sharply above its <unk> <unk> fourth-quarter ceiling of N million according to opec and industry officials at an oil conference here <unk> by the oil daily and the international <unk> <unk>
at that rate a majority of opec 's N members have reached their output limits they said
but it is estimated that at least three million barrels a day and possibly as much as seven million barrels a day of <unk> capacity still <unk> within opec
most is <unk> in five <unk> gulf countries including his own <unk> <unk> <unk> 's oil minister told the conference friday
he puts opec 's current capacity at N million to N million barrels a day
that 's higher than some other estimates
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 's oil minister recently estimated opec capacity at N million barrels a day
either way the <unk> is big enough to keep <unk> <unk> oil markets on edge
even modest amounts of additional output by those with the huge extra capacity and reserves such as saudi <unk> and <unk> could <unk> the market
the <unk> oil minister and saudi oil minister <unk> <unk> <unk> in their comments to the conference that their countries would act <unk> to maintain a stable market
however in <unk> later both ministers <unk> that they expect future opec <unk> to be based mainly on the production capacity and reserves of each member
under that approach countries with the most <unk> oil capacity would get bigger shares of any future increases in opec 's production ceiling than they would under the current system
if you are already producing at N N or N N of your capacity what 's the good to be told you can produce at N N of capacity asked mr. <unk>
at an <unk> geneva meeting late last month opec 's oil ministers <unk> approved another increase of one million barrels a day in their production ceiling
they <unk> it out using the existing formula however which meant that even those countries that could n't produce more received higher official <unk>
the main effect of the ceiling boost was to <unk> some of the <unk> already coming from the <unk> <unk>
still there was a <unk> at geneva
previously no opec member had been willing to accept a reduction in its percentage share of the group 's total output target or ceiling
but the concept of <unk> <unk> for those with <unk> capacity advanced there in an <unk> proposal was generally <unk> by the ministers
in the end politics got in the way
<unk> accepted iran 's proposal only so long as it was promised production <unk> with <unk>
and the united arab <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> refused to give any guarantee it would change its ways
but the oil ministers continue to study the plan and it will probably be the basis for <unk> at next month 's meeting
it 's understood several <unk> already have been worked into the plan
the ceiling would be <unk> to N million barrels to provide <unk> and the united arab <unk> much higher official <unk> while reducing percentage shares of some others
<unk> 's previous conditions are no longer considered a problem although the united arab <unk> is still an issue
saudi <unk> opec 's <unk> also has <unk> as a possible <unk> some opec sources said
<unk> on a N N share of any ceiling saudi officials have long <unk> for the <unk> <unk> distribution of increases to all members
in geneva however they supported iran 's proposal because it would have left the saudi percentage of the opec total <unk> and increased actual saudi volume to nearly N million barrels daily from five million
some of the proposed <unk> since however call on saudi <unk> to give back to the <unk> pool a <unk> N barrels
though <unk> that 's a reduction in its share
mr. <unk> the saudi oil minister <unk> here that the <unk> would insist on maintaining its percentage share of opec production under any <unk> <unk>
under any circumstances saudi <unk> should get more rather than less mr. <unk> said
in a blow to france 's <unk> <unk> <unk> the french navy for the first time publicly stated its desire to buy N <unk> douglas corp. <unk> <unk> to defend its aircraft carriers
the statement is likely to <unk> the debate within france 's military <unk> over the <unk> which is made by <unk> <unk> <unk> aviation <unk>
in an interview in the navy 's official weekly magazine <unk> <unk> the navy 's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said the navy still intends to buy N <unk> as scheduled in the late 1990s and early <unk> century
the air force is to take at least N more
<unk> <unk> said the navy ca n't wait until N when the <unk> <unk> becomes available to replace its <unk> fleet of <unk> <unk> used since the <unk> to protect carriers from attack
rather than <unk> the <unk> which <unk> is <unk> to do for around N billion french francs $ N million <unk> <unk> said the navy wants to buy used <unk> from the u.s. navy
officially the statement is n't an attack on the <unk>
<unk> <unk> said that when the <unk> wear out the navy is prepared to take <unk> to replace them
but <unk> senior navy officials sharply <unk> the <unk> as an air force plane <unk> to carrier use
although they never said so publicly they have made no secret of their preference for the <unk> on operational <unk>
<unk> <unk> 's comments are likely to <unk> the broader dispute within the military <unk> here over the role of <unk>
although <unk> <unk> still is run by the founder 's son chairman <unk> <unk> who has <unk> protected his company 's independence
the <unk> project is the result of france 's <unk> jointly to develop a plane with other countries and french officials question whether the state can continue paying for expensive independent programs
so far mr. <unk> has <unk> pressure to change
what brought the <unk> issue to a head is that the <unk> are <unk> falling apart without any immediate plan to replace them
<unk> <unk> a former <unk> <unk> leader said that the last other country to use <unk> the <unk> retired its last ones two years ago
a french <unk> crash a few months ago <unk> pressure for new planes here
<unk> <unk> rejected <unk> 's proposal to <unk> the <unk> saying the cost was impossible to estimate
even <unk> he said the <unk> represent an <unk> and dangerous protection for the aircraft carriers france has sent to meet such <unk> as the wars in lebanon and the <unk> gulf
defense minister <unk> <unk> told a meeting of the <unk> press association that the question of <unk> the <unk> or buying used <unk> is a political decision that he will make in due time

for cathay pacific airways the <unk> ride may be ending
the first signs of trouble came last month when the hong kong carrier a subsidiary of <unk> pacific ltd. posted a N N drop in operating profit for the first six months and warned that margins will remain under pressure for the rest of the year
securities analysts many of whom <unk> their buy <unk> after seeing cathay 's <unk> figures believe more <unk> <unk> ahead
fuel and personnel costs are rising and <unk> in and through hong kong remains <unk> by china 's turmoil since the june N <unk> in beijing
in addition delivery delays for the first two of as many as N boeing <unk> that the carrier has ordered have raised costs because personnel had been hired to man the planes
and tough competition in the air-freight market is cutting into an important <unk>
there also is concern that once hong kong <unk> to china 's <unk> in N cathay will be forced to play second <unk> to china 's <unk> flag carrier civil aviation administration of china or <unk>
the sense is we would never be in a position again where everything works for us the way it did before says <unk> <unk> cathay 's commercial director
<unk> hall an analyst at james <unk> far east ltd. says there is n't much cathay can do about rising costs for <unk> fuel hong kong 's tight labor market or the <unk> of the local currency which is <unk> to the u.s. dollar
these factors are further complicated by the airline 's push to <unk> itself from a regional carrier to an international one ms. hall says
ms. hall expects cathay 's profit to grow around N N annually this year and next
in N it earned $ N billion hong kong us$ N million on revenue of <unk> N billion
cathay is taking several steps to bolster business
one step is to beef up its fleet
in addition to aircraft from boeing co. cathay announced earlier this year an order for as many as N <unk> <unk>
the expansion which could cost as much as us$ N billion over the next eight years will expand the fleet to about N planes by N up from N at the end of last year according to sun <unk> <unk> securities ltd
the <unk> <unk> planes will be used largely to replace cathay 's <unk> fleet of lockheed <unk> for regional flights while the boeing aircraft will be used on <unk> routes to europe and north america
cathay also is moving some of its <unk> <unk> operations outside hong kong
<unk> bidding for young employees in hong kong is pushing up cathay 's labor costs by N N a year for <unk> staff while experienced <unk> employees are leaving the <unk> as part of the <unk> <unk>
some jobs already have been moved to australia and there are plans to place others in canada
david bell a spokesman for the airline says the move is partly aimed at <unk> existing staff who are leaving to secure foreign <unk> ahead of N
cathay is working to promote hong kong as a <unk> worth <unk> on its own <unk> rather than just a <unk>
although the june N <unk> in beijing have hurt its china flights cathay 's other routes have retained high load factors
mr. <unk> <unk> promoting hong kong as an important part of <unk> visitors from japan south korea and taiwan where the number of people looking to travel abroad has surged
there also has been speculation that cathay will be among the major <unk> participants in the hong kong government 's plans to build a new airport with the carrier possibly investing in its own <unk>
cathay officials decline to comment on the speculation
mr. <unk> sees <unk> with other carriers particularly cathay 's recent link with amr corp. 's american airlines as an important part of cathay 's strategy
but he <unk> that cathay has n't any interest in <unk> equity stakes with the u.s. carrier or with lufthansa the west german airline with which it has <unk> for about a decade
analysts believe cathay is approached for such <unk> by other carriers on a regular basis particularly as the <unk> of share exchanges has grown among european carriers
we think <unk> are very important mr. <unk> says
but we 'd rather put funds into our own business rather than someone else 's
i 'm not sure <unk> would necessarily make things <unk>
in a pattern it <unk> to <unk> in several key u.s. <unk> cathay recently announced plans to serve san francisco by flying into american airlines ' los angeles <unk> and <unk> continuing passengers onto a flight on the u.s. carrier
we 'll never have a big operation in the u.s. and they 'll never have one as big as us in the pacific mr. <unk> says
but this way american will <unk> good <unk> to boston new york chicago and dallas
we 'll <unk> on this end to places like <unk> singapore and <unk>
asian traffic which currently accounts for N N of cathay 's business is expected to continue as the carrier 's <unk>
cathay has long stated its desire to double its weekly flights into china to N and it is <unk> to <unk> <unk> flights into vietnam
further expansion into southern europe is also possible says mr. bell the spokesman
while a large number of hong kong companies have <unk> <unk> ahead of N such a move is n't an option for cathay because it would <unk> its landing rights in hong kong
and mr. <unk> <unk> rules out a move to london our <unk> is hong kong traffic rights
he says the airline is putting its <unk> in the <unk> agreement on hong kong 's return to china
a special section dealing with aviation rights states that landing rights for hong kong 's airlines which include the smaller hong kong <unk> airlines will continue to be negotiated by hong kong 's government
but critics <unk> that <unk> officials ultimately will be responsible to beijing
my feeling is cathay does n't have a hope in the long run says an analyst who declines to be identified
cathay would love to keep going but the general sense is they 're going to have to do something
mr. <unk> acknowledges that the carrier will have to <unk> and <unk> to local changes but he <unk> that the <unk> agreement is firm ground to build on for the <unk> future
we 're confident that it <unk> our <unk> structure he says and our ability to grow and <unk>

the neighborhood around <unk> <unk> co. 's <unk> shopping center in the <unk> section of los angeles <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> of many <unk> cities and certainly is n't the sort of area one would choose to visit
but turn into the shopping center 's parking lot and one could be in the safe busy <unk> of a <unk> <unk>
only it is safer and <unk>
over the past year there have been only one <unk> three <unk> of or from <unk> no <unk> and one attempted <unk> in the <unk> which opened in late N
a shopping center of similar size in an <unk> los angeles <unk> would per year be expected to have eight <unk> N <unk> of or from <unk> and four <unk>
the <unk> <unk> has annual sales of more than $ N per <unk> square foot the figure for a comparable suburban shopping center would be $ N
three other <unk> shopping centers in the <unk> area are doing almost as well
a successful <unk> <unk> in a <unk> area <unk> the more typical <unk> pattern in which commercial areas are taken over by <unk> <unk> <unk> and the criminal <unk> with an <unk> of the customer base development capital and <unk>
major regional and national chain stores are replaced by <unk> operations offering <unk> merchandise at higher prices
along with the <unk> of shopping opportunities is an <unk> of the jobs that the major chains used to provide to community residents
thus there is even more to the <unk> center than a good place to shop
this <unk> commercial <unk> becomes for the residents a secure <unk> in a <unk> urban <unk> evidence that community <unk> is not <unk> and that the <unk> are not <unk>
the center <unk> the community image to <unk> as well and may help to arrest or even reverse the <unk> of capital and investment
an additional benefit is the <unk> of jobs
this starts in the construction phase through the use of minority contractors and local workers
it continues through the life of the center the <unk> center has created N permanent <unk> jobs at a one-time cost in public funds of only $ N per job
as many of these jobs are filled by local residents who move from the <unk> <unk> to the tax <unk> the $ <unk> public investment should <unk> itself in a few years
and that is before consideration of increased state and local revenues from taxes and fees on sales real estate licenses and the like
profits are also <unk> back into the community the <unk> <unk> economic development corp. receives N N of the profits from the <unk> center and uses the money to provide moderate and <unk> housing in the community now running into the hundreds of units as well as commercial and industrial development projects
<unk> <unk> director of the mayor 's city economic development office says there is no question that <unk> had a <unk> effect on the surrounding neighborhood
what had been a <unk> area with nothing but <unk> shops and <unk> shops is now <unk> a major <unk> in the housing and commercial stock thanks to a <unk> <unk> source of <unk> capital that <unk> yields
another benefit is that substantial <unk> of the <unk> in these centers are minority <unk> and women
in the grand <unk> <unk> developed by <unk> realty group in chicago 's third <unk> <unk> the robert taylor homes N N of the stores to date have been <unk> to blacks and N N to members of other minority groups
children from the community will have <unk> role models than the drug <unk>
so what 's the catch
primarily that putting one of these <unk> deals together takes time <unk> <unk> of vision and negotiating <unk> that not all developers <unk>
security costs are also quite high
one of these centers can involve years of negotiating with numerous public agencies local political leaders and <unk> groups and with <unk> <unk> and sources of financing
suburban deals are not without their delays and <unk> <unk> deals just have more of them
security at a typical <unk> <unk> center is <unk> but <unk>
the entire site is <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a small number of <unk> <unk>
<unk> and <unk> give it a <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> motion detectors and <unk> tv <unk> monitor the entire center <unk> levels are three to five times the industry standard
the security <unk> post <unk> as <unk> retail space has its own <unk> 's <unk> above the <unk> of the other buildings with a <unk> view of the entire center
local law enforcement is present in a <unk> <unk> space <unk> by the center
these features are also used in <unk> realty group 's grand <unk> <unk>
<unk> has its own large security force of <unk> and <unk> personnel on <unk> duty at each center
security is N N to N N of the common area charges of these centers vs. an industry average of about N N
these security costs are kept <unk> because the centers ' site acquisition construction and financing costs were reduced by such programs as urban development action grants economic development administration grants community development block grants <unk> industrial development bonds enterprise <unk> tax <unk> city <unk> grants and tax <unk> financing
many of these programs no longer exist or have been <unk> cut back
however since these centers appear to pay for themselves there is nothing to prevent state and local governments from <unk> legislation with similar provisions
many states already have enterprise <unk> and legislation that <unk> tax incentives loans and grants to encourage investment in depressed areas with requirements for the hiring of the <unk> and minorities
these programs could be expanded to focus on funds for project planning <unk> sources of funds and for acquiring a site and preparing it
<unk> crime and the fear of it in <unk> commercial areas should give enterprise <unk> more success than most have <unk> to date
with many suburban areas <unk> <unk> with shopping centers <unk> areas may represent a major new <unk> market for investment
new approaches to <unk> design and operation make it possible to <unk> these markets
if the risks and <unk> are reasonable developers will respond
government officials who wonder how important it is for them to encourage development in high-risk areas should visit <unk> and grand <unk> <unk> and decide for themselves

<unk> smaller growth stocks have n't been in favor recently
the average issue on standard & poor 's 500-stock index gained N N last year ms. <unk> of painewebber says
<unk> earnings by comparison rose between N N and N N
in addition earnings growth took a back seat to cash flow restructuring and takeover potential and <unk> value as the preferred <unk> standards for much of the year
also the smaller growth stocks are n't widely traded and so are harder to buy and sell quickly than blue chips
as a result morgan stanley 's index of N emerging growth stocks most of which are in the otc market is up only N N for the year while the dow jones industrial average has <unk> N N and the s&p N has grown N N
the nasdaq composite has gained N N this year but that 's largely due to the N largest <unk> stocks which have soared N N

for bankers and regulators arizona is looking more like texas every day
on friday los angeles-based first interstate <unk> said it expects a net loss of $ N million for the third quarter of N because of <unk> at its first interstate bank of arizona unit
first interstate said the unit <unk> by arizona 's <unk> real-estate <unk> will have a $ N million loss for the quarter
first interstate took a huge $ N million provision for loan losses at the arizona bank
it charged off an estimated $ N million of arizona loans leaving the unit with a reserve for future losses of $ N million about N N of its $ N million of troubled loans and <unk> real estate
first interstate made the move under pressure from regulators
the action capped a <unk> of <unk> arizona banking news for the third quarter and <unk> <unk> that arizona is <unk> texas 's long <unk> as banking 's <unk> <unk>

security pacific corp. said third-quarter credit losses surged a third to $ N million mainly because of <unk> arizona real-estate loans
new york-based chase manhattan corp. took an $ N million <unk> charge
<unk> the regulatory <unk> behind first interstate 's loss suggests regulators have concluded that lenders ' reserves are far too low to absorb their future arizona losses and are <unk> bankers to do something about it
<unk> from the office of the comptroller of the currency had been <unk> through first interstate 's real-estate portfolio since last month they first recommended that first interstate take a provision that was less than the <unk> $ N million third-quarter hit
when first interstate <unk> <unk> that the figure was too high regulators responded by raising their <unk> to $ N million
at that point first interstate decided it was the better part of <unk> not to <unk> further said one industry official close to the talks
thomas p. <unk> chief financial officer would n't comment about the details of the negotiations
he said the provision was n't forced upon us but the regulators made it very clear what they thought was an appropriate number
the tough regulatory stance <unk> large future losses especially at the state 's thrifts
at least six of arizona 's N savings and loan institutions have either been taken over by the government 's <unk> program or are essentially insolvent they are sitting on enormous <unk> losses
for example western savings & loan association which is now in <unk> had <unk> <unk> <unk> liabilities of a negative $ N million at june N
it had a $ N million loss in the second quarter
yet it still held $ N million of <unk> real estate for which it <unk> no reserves <unk>
it also had $ N million of <unk> loans its level of reserves against those was n't immediately available though it is believed to be small
the rapid <unk> of the arizona thrifts only adds to the <unk> cost of the government 's massive thrift bailout officially estimated at about $ N billion
together the six <unk> or essentially insolvent arizona thrifts have <unk> capital of a negative $ N billion <unk> property of $ N billion and <unk> loans of $ N billion
they have no reserves against the real estate and their reserves against the loans are <unk> compared with the levels of reserves banks are moving to set up
the thrifts had a combined loss of $ N million in the second quarter
other lenders have been <unk> only N cents to N cents on the dollar on <unk> arizona property if they can sell it at all
all this <unk> is the result of one of the worst <unk> in arizona 's <unk> history <unk> by some of the usual <unk> in 1980s banking <unk> <unk> fraud and <unk> bad banking

it 's <unk> mr. <unk> said
moreover mr. <unk> and others said residential real estate which had remained fairly strong through most of the downturn is beginning to <unk> more and more of the <unk>
and the generally <unk> condition of arizona 's lenders means there is little capital available in the state to shore up the economy and slow down the slide
it 's reasonable to say there is not a <unk> s&l in the state and the amount of <unk> bank capital is very low said mr. jackson
we 're going to see another big wave of failures and defaults between now and year-end
the only thing a lot of these lenders can get out of their <unk> now is pay me in N days

analysts expect conner 's earnings to reach roughly $ N million or $ N to $ N a share on sales of $ N million for N the company 's third full year in business
that 's a faster growth rate than reported by compaq which did n't post similar results until its fourth year in N
but compaq had achieved that level of sales faster than any previous manufacturing start-up
conner 's performance is closely tied to the <unk> demand for <unk> computers the computer industry 's <unk> segment
since its <unk> conner has both benefited from and helped make possible the rapid spread of <unk> computers by selling storage devices that <unk> five to N times less electricity than drives used in desktop machines

the <unk> losses cap a <unk> year for alan bond and his <unk> bond corp
only a year ago the chairman of bond corp. who controls about N N of the company appeared to be building a war <unk> to attack some big companies
now bond corp. has agreed to sell at least half its australian brewing assets
it has sold billions of dollars of other assets and has more on the block
but in a tv interview sunday mr. bond said we 've taken a big loss

the result will ultimately be a very different group in size and structure bond corp. directors said in a statement
some analysts contend the total <unk> should have been much greater and bond corp. 's <unk> cited a list of several assets and deals about which there is uncertainty regarding the current value and potential impact on the firm
bond corp. said the acknowledged losses mean net asset backing is in the red to the <unk> of N australian cents a share vs. positive asset backing of a$ N a share a year ago
still the directors said having fully considered all aspects of the company 's state of affairs and future cash <unk> the directors <unk> <unk> that the company is <unk>

the reason was not high interest rates or labor costs

israel <unk> is only one of the thousands of entrepreneurs and their employees who will be injured or killed by crime this year
the u.s. bureau of justice statistics reports that almost N N of all <unk> workers suffer injuries from crime each year almost twice the national average and about four times the rate for teachers truck drivers medical workers and <unk> salespeople
only a few other <unk> have higher reported rates of criminal <unk> such as police <unk> and <unk> drivers
yet these figures show only the most visible part of the problem
recent data from new york city provide more of the picture
while by no means the highest crime community in the country new york is a prime example of a city where crime <unk> small-business development
a survey of small businesses there was conducted this spring by <unk> a policy research organization
it gave N businesses a <unk> and <unk> N <unk>
the survey found that over a <unk> period N N of the firms said employees or owners had been <unk> on their way to or from work or while on the job
<unk> percent reported their customers being <unk>
crime was the reason that N N reported difficulty <unk> personnel and that N N said they were considering moving
more than one-third of the <unk> businesses said they suffer from drug dealing and <unk> near their <unk>
in <unk> and the <unk> one out of four commercial firms is <unk> each year
industrial <unk> fare even worse with <unk> rates twice the <unk> average
crime is clearly more <unk> to <unk> <unk> than to big businesses
two decades ago the small business administration reported <unk> <unk> albert <unk> 's <unk> study of crime against N small businesses <unk> from national irs records
he found that monetary crime losses as a <unk> of gross receipts were N times higher for small businesses than for large ones
the new york study 's companies <unk> N employees their annual crime losses <unk> about $ N with an additional $ N annual cost in security enough money to hire at least one more worker
the costs of crime may also be enough to <unk> a struggling business
whatever the monetary crime losses they may not be nearly as important to entrepreneurs as the risk of personal <unk>
after repeated <unk> <unk> some entrepreneurs may give up a business out of fear for their lives
one washington couple recently sold their liquor store after N years in business that included four <unk> deaths and N <unk> or <unk> on the <unk>
these findings <unk> the <unk> cycle that national institute of justice director james <unk> <unk> calls crime causing poverty
<unk> <unk> offer relatively few employment opportunities <unk> to the poverty of local residents
small neighborhood businesses could provide more jobs if crime were not so <unk> to creating and maintaining those businesses
this may help explain why small businesses create N N of all jobs <unk> but only N N of jobs in a <unk> city like new york
bigger business can often better afford to <unk> the cost of crime
the new york study found that the cost of security measures in firms with fewer than five employees was almost $ N per worker compared with one-third that amount for firms with more than N employees
the shift of retailing to large shopping centers has created even greater <unk> of scale for providing <unk> business <unk>
private security <unk> and <unk> police can <unk> the law of <unk> to <unk> access to these <unk> places
since N in fact revenues of the N largest guard companies primarily serving such big businesses have increased by almost N N
few small neighborhood businesses however can afford such protection even in <unk> with other local merchants
in the <unk> with the highest crime rates small business generally <unk> on the public police force for protection
this <unk> several problems
one is that there are not enough police to <unk> small businesses
the number one proposal for reducing crime in the new york survey was to put more police on foot or <unk> <unk> suggested by more than two-thirds of the respondents
only N N supported private security <unk> funded by the merchants themselves
a second problem is the <unk> <unk> of false <unk> which can make urban police less than <unk> about <unk> to calls from small businesses
only half the new york small businesses surveyed for their part are <unk> with the police response they receive
some cities including new york have <unk> with special tax districts for commercial areas that provide additional <unk> funded by local businesses
but this raises added cost barriers to urban <unk>
another solution cities might consider is giving special priority to police <unk> of small-business areas
for cities losing business to suburban shopping centers it may be a <unk> business investment to help keep those jobs and sales taxes within city limits
increased <unk> of business <unk> makes sense because urban crime is heavily <unk> in such hot <unk> of <unk> <unk>
with national institute of justice support the minneapolis police and the crime control institute are currently testing the effects of such a strategy <unk> its <unk> value with traditional <unk> <unk>
small-business <unk> would be an especially <unk> <unk> <unk> a small-business person is scheduled to <unk> against a <unk> suspect

that 's a fundamental <unk> for investors but its truth was <unk> once again in the performance of mutual funds during and after the stock market 's <unk> plunge
stock funds like the market as a whole generally dropped more than N N in the week through last thursday according to figures compiled by <unk> <unk> services inc
that reflects the huge drop a week ago friday last monday 's rebound and the <unk> and <unk> that followed
but several other types of funds <unk> investors from the worst of the market 's slide
funds that invest <unk> were the <unk> stock and fixed-income funds
more than ever people should realize they should have a <unk> portfolio said <unk> <unk> a senior vice president of <unk> group
that means stocks bonds money market instruments and real estate
one week 's performance should n't be the basis for any investment decision
but the latest mutual fund performance figures do show what can happen when the going gets <unk>
you want to know how a fund did when the market got <unk> said <unk> <unk> an investment adviser with <unk> & <unk> in san francisco
it 's like <unk> the <unk> of a car
what you want to know is when the road 's <unk> when there 's <unk> and <unk> how 's this car going to <unk>
general equity funds fell an average of N N in the week ended thursday compared with a N N slide for the standard & poor 's 500-stock index
but <unk> <unk> 's figures show that there were a number of ways investors could have <unk> themselves from the stock market 's gyrations
<unk> funds for instance which invest in companies that mine and process the precious metal posted an average decline of N N
<unk> portfolio funds which <unk> investments among stocks bonds and money-market instruments and other investments declined at about half the rate of stock funds an average drop of N N according to <unk>
global <unk> funds take the <unk> concept one step further by investing at least N N of their portfolios outside the u.s.
this gives them the added benefits of international <unk> including a foreign-exchange boost during periods like the past week when the dollar declines against other major currencies
with all that going for them global <unk> portfolio funds declined only N N in the week through last thursday
but while the <unk> of <unk> <unk> through when times are tough there 's also a price to pay a <unk> portfolio always <unk> an <unk> portfolio during those times when the investment in the <unk> portfolio is truly hot
and friday the <unk> <unk> stocks have been this year 's hot investment
thus even including the latest week the average general stock fund has soared more than N N so far this year the <unk> <unk> figures show
by comparison global asset <unk> funds have turned in an average total return of about N N while domestic <unk> portfolios are up about N N
fixed-income funds have returned N N while gold funds which tend to be volatile have risen just N N on average
that 's the problem with trying to <unk> too much said mr. <unk>
you do n't make any real money
over the last N years for example mr. <unk> says an investor putting $ N a year in the s&p N would have made nearly twice as much than if it were invested in treasury bills
some equity funds did better than others in the week that began on friday the <unk>
the $ N million <unk> fund for instance was the <unk> top <unk> fund for the week with a N N return
its return so far this year has been a <unk> N N
the fund 's strategy is to sell when a stock <unk> N N over its cost
by the time the market plummeted N days ago <unk> was N N in cash said robert <unk> president and portfolio manager
last monday he started buying the <unk> growth companies that people were <unk> away at discount prices
among mr. <unk> 's <unk> <unk> systems reebok international ltd. and digital <unk> corp
the fund 's cash position is now about N N which mr. <unk> calls still bearish
among the big stock funds <unk> fund with more than $ N billion in assets had a decline of just N N for the week and a return of N N for the year
howard stein chairman of <unk> corp. said the fund was about half invested in government bonds on oct. N and about N N in cash
in a downward market bonds act better he said
we still think there 's a lot of <unk> in this market
we believe interest rates will continue to trend lower and the economy will slow around the world
many of the funds that did best in the last week are heavily invested overseas giving them the benefit of foreign currency <unk> when the dollar is weak
from its high point on thursday oct. N to where it traded late in new york a week later the dollar fell N N against the west german mark N N against the british pound and N N against the japanese yen
three international cash portfolios funds which invest almost <unk> in bonds and money-market instruments overseas were among the four <unk> funds in the latest week
because the funds ' investments are <unk> in foreign currencies their value expressed in dollars goes up when those currencies rise against the dollar
but when the dollar rises against major foreign currencies as it did for much of this year the dollar value of these funds declines
all three funds posted negative returns for the year to date
of the funds that <unk> the worst in the <unk> N week two are heavily invested in airlines stocks which led the market slide following problems with financing for the ual corp buy-out plan
reflecting airline takeover activity however both the <unk> select air transportation portfolio and the national aviation & technology fund posted <unk> returns for the the year to date N N for the <unk> air transportation fund and a <unk> N N for national aviation & technology
the small drop in equity funds in general in the latest week may not necessarily be a good sign said a. michael <unk> president of <unk> <unk>
noting that equity funds are up nearly N N from their <unk> low on dec. N N he said that what happened last week may not be enough of an adjustment
there 's either more to come or an extremely long period of <unk>
but investors do n't seem to think so
several big mutual fund groups said last week that cash <unk> into stock funds were <unk> than usual after heavy <unk> on the <unk>
<unk> group said it had a more than $ N million net <unk> into its stock funds last week
there certainly has n't been a panic reaction said steven <unk> a vice president at t. rowe price associates

mr. dinkins the manhattan <unk> president can afford more <unk> and <unk> because he holds a comfortable <unk> lead in most of the <unk> polls

this is the nation 's biggest city and traditionally its mayor is the nation 's <unk> urban <unk>
democrats hoped that mr. dinkins could become a highly visible national leader
republicans figured that in mr. giuliani the nation 's <unk> prosecutor they had a chance for a huge <unk> in the heart of democratic <unk> and that they would pick up a new political star

he simply has n't explained why something worth a million dollars ended up worth $ N two years later says mr. powers the giuliani campaign manager
it 's <unk> for him to suggest it 's the difference between <unk> value of the shares and their market value
so far though no one not even former u.s. attorney giuliani has been able to <unk> just what law mr. dinkins has broken or just what tax he has <unk>

<unk> group inc. <unk> <unk> expects to report that net income in the third quarter ended oct. N fell N N to N N from $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier
robert stein president and chief executive officer attributed the expected decline partly to the effects of a <unk> strike last month at the company 's <unk> ohio <unk> facility
<unk> orders in early september also played a role he said in an interview
but mr. stein said he is <unk> confident that earnings for the full year will exceed the $ N million or N cents a share in N
that would require fourth-quarter net of more than about N cents to N cents a share assuming that mr. stein 's third-quarter estimate <unk> <unk>
in the year-earlier fourth quarter the company had profit of $ N million or N cents a share
third-quarter revenue is expected to be $ N million to $ N million up from $ N million a year earlier according to <unk> <unk> treasurer
the year-earlier periods do n't reflect results of the company 's <unk> corp. unit acquired last january but include some canadian operations that were sold at the end of N
august through october traditionally is the <unk> season for the <unk> business as many retailers use the goods as <unk> promotional items
mr. stein said some retailers perhaps <unk> about <unk> inventories appear to have held back on orders in september but have been <unk> more heavily in october
mr. stein said <unk> is <unk> profitable but has n't performed as well as expected
<unk> 's <unk> <unk> and other <unk> products are doing very well and its plastic <unk> products are <unk> for growth he said
but the unit 's third segment <unk> <unk> is suffering from a depressed market and <unk> is seeking to sell that segment he said

prior to acquiring the <unk> business the company was known as <unk> corp. <unk> had been a maker of computer <unk> but mr. stein and other officers decided to sell that business after japanese competitors <unk> a dominant share of the market
mr. stein said <unk> operating controls have <unk> <unk> to reduce <unk> levels N N to N N improve <unk> delivery of orders to about N N from around N N and to lower the number of labor hours required to produce a unit
by moving the design of new products <unk> instead of <unk> out the work the company also has been able to come up with designs that can be <unk> more <unk> he said
in addition to those measures the company spent heavily earlier this year to <unk> displays at its customers ' retail outlets a strategy that mr. stein said has helped bolster <unk> of the company 's brands
<unk> 's <unk> operation makes <unk> tools and <unk> as well as <unk> at factories in the u.s. and canada
the main issue in the strike at the ohio facility was health-care benefits mr. stein said
the strike ended <unk>
<unk> continues to seek further acquisitions in the <unk> industry mr. stein said
he indicated that <unk> may be interested in acquiring another company with revenue in the range of $ N million to $ N million partly because mass <unk> increasingly want to rely on larger and fewer suppliers
after several years of <unk> business with china foreign traders are <unk> for the biggest slump in a decade
the <unk> of <unk> measures starting last october already had begun to <unk> when the <unk> in <unk> square on june N and subsequent events <unk> the <unk> far <unk>

in <unk> <unk> 's representative office received no orders in june
at first it attributed the slump to temporary business <unk> but when no orders were <unk> in august and september manager donald <unk> became convinced that business would be bad for many months
things have grown worse since june N mr. <unk> says
he predicts that sales will drop between N N and N N from last year 's $ N million
the <unk> and <unk> sectors are <unk> the <unk> of china 's <unk> measures and foreign companies such as <unk> that deal with those industries are being hit the <unk>
but in general all <unk> companies are feeling the <unk>
the import <unk> will <unk> says john <unk> first vice president of the american chamber of commerce in hong kong and a china trade specialist
on the down side sales could fall as much as N N for some companies on the upper side sales will be flat
china 's foreign trade has gone in <unk> during the past decade
the last time that traders experienced a <unk> was during N when beijing imposed tough measures to curb imports and <unk> foreign exchange
the current <unk> is expected to be much <unk> because beijing has cut off domestic funds from factories for the first time to slow inflation
in addition the suspension of loans and export credits from foreign governments and institutions following the june <unk> have been a big setback
the <unk> on new lending is dealing the single biggest blow to trading says raymond <unk> china manager for <unk> ag a west german <unk> company
import growth from the year-earlier months slowed to N N in july and N N in august compared with an average growth rate of N N in the first half
in the first eight months of N imports grew N N to $ N billion down slightly from a growth rate of N N a year earlier
the picture for china 's exports is just as <unk> mainly because of the domestic credit squeeze
exports in the first eight months grew only N N to $ N billion compared with a growth rate of N N a year earlier according to chinese <unk> figures
the threat to china 's balance of payments is further <unk> by the plunge in its foreign-exchange reserves excluding gold holdings
the reserves dropped for the first time in recent years to $ N billion in june from $ N billion in april
the trend has prompted beijing to <unk> efforts to curb imports
in recent weeks china 's leaders have <unk> trading in <unk> and <unk> of chemical products and commodities
the ministry of foreign economic relations and trade set up a special bureau last month to monitor the issue of import and export licenses
beijing 's <unk> <unk> on imports have <unk> many trading companies that the best way to get through the <unk> is by helping china export
for example <unk> <unk> corp. one of the biggest japanese trading houses now buys almost twice as many goods from china as it sells to that country
three years ago the ratio was <unk>
but the strategy is n't helping much this time
both sectors of imports and exports look just as bad says <unk> <unk> general manager of <unk> <unk> 's <unk> office
he expects the company 's trading business to drop as much as N N this year
for a short time after june N it appeared that the trade picture would remain fairly bright
many foreign trading offices in hong kong were <unk> with <unk> and telephone calls from chinese trade officials urging them not to <unk> ties
even the bank of china which normally took weeks to process letters of credit was <unk> the letters at record speed to <unk> rumors about the bank 's financial health
but when foreign traders tried to do business they discovered that the <unk> of chinese trade officials was just a <unk>
the suspension of foreign loans has weakened the buying power of china 's national trading companies which are among the country 's biggest <unk>
business is n't any better on the <unk> or municipal level foreign traders say

it has difficulties paying its foreign debts says a hong kong executive who is familiar with <unk> 's business
how can it make available funds for purchases
foreign traders also say many of china 's big <unk> projects have been canceled or <unk> because of the squeeze on domestic and foreign credit
albert lee a veteran trader who <unk> in machinery sales estimates that as many as N N of projects that had obtained approval to proceed have been canceled in recent months
there are virtually no new projects and that means no new business for us he says
even when new lending <unk> foreign exchange would still be tight because beijing will likely try to <unk> in foreign borrowing which has grown between N N and N N in the past few years
and foreign creditors are likely to be more cautious about <unk> new loans because china is <unk> a peak <unk> period as many loans start falling due in the next two to five years
another reason for the <unk> of the trade problems is that beijing has extended the current <unk> on imports beyond the usual target of consumer products to include steel chemical <unk> and plastics
these have been among the country 's leading imports particularly last year when there were <unk> that led many traders to buy heavily and pay <unk>
but the <unk> also <unk> <unk> speculation and <unk> prices
to stem speculation beijing imposed ceiling prices that went into effect earlier this year
traders who had bought the goods at prices above the ceiling do n't want to take a loss on <unk> and are holding onto their stock
the resulting <unk> has depressed the market
but beijing ca n't cut back on such essential imports as raw materials for too long without <unk> the country 's export business
mr. <unk> the china trade expert estimates that as much as N N of <unk> 's exports is made up of <unk> imported raw materials

the collapse of a $ N billion buy-out of united airlines parent ual corp. has <unk> wall street 's takeover stock speculators their worst loss ever on a single deal
their $ N <unk> in estimated paper losses easily <unk> the $ N million in paper losses the takeover traders known as <unk> suffered in N when gulf oil co. dropped a $ N billion offer for cities service co
in the six trading days since the ual labor-management buy-out group failed to get bank financing <unk> friday with the withdrawal of its partner british airways plc ual stock has plummeted by N N to N N from N N
the <unk> may <unk> some of their paper losses if the ual deal gets <unk> up again as they did in N when occidental petroleum co. <unk> them with a $ N billion takeover of cities service
in the <unk> the question faced by investors is what is ual stock worth
the short answer on a fundamental basis is that airline analysts say the stock is worth <unk> between $ N and $ N a share
that 's based on a <unk> of <unk> between N to N times ual earnings which are estimated to come in <unk> around $ N a share this year
airline stocks typically sell at a discount of about one-third to the stock market 's <unk> ratio which is currently about N times earnings
that 's because airline earnings like those of auto makers have been subject to the cyclical <unk> of the economy
that analysis <unk> up with stock traders ' reports that despite the huge drop in the stock ual has n't returned to the level at which it could attract buying by institutions <unk> on the basis of earnings
so anyone buying the stock now is <unk> on some special transaction such as a recapitalization or takeover and must do so using some <unk> about the <unk> of such an event
one analyst who asked not to be identified said he believes that the ual pilots and management can put together a bid in the $ N area but that it could take three to four months to close
at that level and given the uncertainty he believes ual stock should trade closer to
other observers note that ual 's board having accepted a bid of $ N a share might hold out for a new bid much closer to the original level even if it means that the management goes back to running the company for a while and <unk> things return to normal
by that <unk> the closing of a deal could be much further away than three to four months even though the <unk> price might be higher
investment bankers following ual agree that the strongest <unk> for an <unk> deal is that the pilots have been attempting a buy-out for more than two years and are n't likely to stop having come so close to success
the pilots have a strong financing <unk> in their <unk> to cut their annual compensation by $ N million and to <unk> $ N million from their retirement funds
on friday they also <unk> the ual flight <unk> to join them
however investment bankers say that banks are n't likely to lend the almost $ N billion that would be necessary for a takeover even at a lower price without someone putting up a hefty <unk> of cash probably even greater than the N N in cash put up by investors in the leveraged takeover of <unk> airlines parent <unk> corp. in july
banks want to see someone putting up real cash at risk that is <unk> to the bank debt in any deal
that way they figure someone else has an even stronger <unk> to make sure the deal is going to work because they would be losing their money before the banks lost <unk>
banks also want to be able to call someone on the telephone to <unk> a problem with a deal that goes bad <unk> someone other than a union leader
that leaves the pilots still in need of cash totaling around $ N billion far more than either they or the flight <unk> can lay their hands on from retirement funds alone
one <unk> to the pilots ' finding such a huge amount of cash is their <unk> on majority ownership
investors such as marvin davis of los angeles who have sought airline ownership this year have <unk> they not the pilots must have control
one way out of that <unk> could be a partial recapitalization in which the pilots would wind up <unk> the value of their concessions with public shareholders
the pilots could <unk> against the value of their concessions using the proceeds to buy back stock from the public and give themselves the majority control they have been seeking
but it is n't clear that banks would lend sufficient money to deliver a big enough price to shareholders
the lack of any new cash probably would still leave the banks <unk>
in advising the ual board on the various bids for the airline starting with one for $ N a share from mr. davis the investment bank of first boston came up with a wide range of potential values for the company depending on <unk> methods and <unk>
using the the <unk> takeover as a benchmark first boston on sept. N estimated that ual was worth $ N to $ N a share based on ual 's results for the N months ending last june N but only $ N to $ N based on a management estimate of results for N
first boston 's estimates had been higher before management <unk> a N <unk>
using estimates of the company 's future earnings under a variety of <unk> first boston estimated ual 's value at $ N to $ N a share if its future labor costs <unk> to wall street projections $ N to $ N if the company reaches a settlement with pilots similar to one at <unk> $ N to $ N under an <unk> labor settlement and $ N to $ N under a pilot contract imposed by the company following a strike
and using <unk> value assuming the sale of all ual assets first boston estimated the airline is worth $ N to $ N a share
unfortunately all those estimates came before airline industry fundamentals <unk> during the past month
american airlines parent amr and usair group both subject to takeover efforts themselves have each warned of declining results
some analysts do n't expect a quick <unk> of any takeover by the pilots
the deal has as one takeover expert puts it so many moving parts
i do n't see anybody who 's sophisticated getting his name associated with this <unk> until the moving parts stop moving
in addition to the need for another cash equity investor the other moving parts include the pilots themselves who can <unk> rival deals by threatening to strike the machinists union the pilots ' longtime rivals who helped <unk> the pilots ' deal and regulators in washington whose opposition to foreign airline investment helped throw the deal into doubt
in the <unk> the <unk> are <unk>

then it turned up and by one estimate the number will be up to about N regulators by next year
holding the <unk> on taxes is the most important task of the bush <unk>
we would have thought by now though that there was a significant core of people involved in government life who understood that direct <unk> is n't the only way to slow down an economy
it is merely the most obvious
what is even more <unk> is that all over the world nations are learning that <unk> public programs often <unk>

confidence in the pound is widely expected to take another sharp <unk> if trade figures for september due for release tomorrow fail to show a substantial improvement from july and august 's <unk> <unk>
chancellor of the <unk> <unk> lawson 's restated commitment to a firm monetary policy has helped to prevent a <unk> in sterling over the past week
but analysts <unk> underlying support for sterling has been <unk> by the chancellor 's failure to announce any new policy measures in his <unk> house speech last thursday
this has increased the risk of the government being forced to increase base rates to N N from their current N N level to defend the pound economists and foreign exchange market analysts say
the risks for sterling of a bad trade figure are very heavily on the down side said <unk> <unk> senior u.k. economist at nomura research institute
if there is another bad trade number there could be an <unk> lot of pressure noted <unk> <unk> u.k. economist for <unk> <unk> a unit of <unk> bank plc
forecasts for the trade figures range widely but few economists expect the data to show a very marked improvement from the # N billion $ N billion deficit in the current account reported for august
the august deficit and the # N billion gap registered in july are topped only by the # N billion deficit of october N
<unk> <unk> european economist at <unk> brothers & co. said there is no sign that britain 's manufacturing industry is <unk> itself to boost exports
at the same time he remains fairly <unk> about the outlook for imports given continued high consumer and capital goods <unk>
he <unk> the current account deficit will narrow to only # N billion in september
however mr. <unk> said he believes that a reduction in raw material <unk> by industry could lead to a sharp drop in imports
combined with at least some rebound in exports after august 's <unk> decline the deficit could narrow to as little as # N billion
mr. <unk> who also forecasts a # N billion current account gap <unk> that even if the trade figures are bullish for sterling the currency wo n't advance much because investors will want to see further evidence of the turnaround before <unk> positions
nevertheless he noted no one will want to go into the trade figures without a flat position in the pound
meanwhile overall evidence on the economy remains fairly <unk>
in his <unk> house speech mr. lawson warned that a further slowdown can be expected as the impact of the last rise in interest rates earlier this month takes effect
u.k. base rates are at their highest level in eight years
but consumer <unk> data released friday do n't suggest that the u.k. economy is slowing that quickly
the figures show that spending rose N N in the third quarter from the second quarter and was up N N from a year ago
this compares with a N N rise in the second from the first quarter and a N N increase from the second quarter of N
mr. <unk> said the data show the economy is still quite strong but suggestions that much of the spending went on services rather than consumer goods should reduce fears of more import rises
certainly the chancellor has made it clear that he is prepared to increase interest rates again if necessary to both ensure that a substantial slowdown does take place and that sterling does n't decline further
thursday he <unk> his audience that the government can not allow the necessary <unk> of monetary policy to be <unk> by exchange rate weakness
analysts agree there is little holding sterling firm at the moment other than mr. lawson 's promise that rates will be pushed higher if necessary
and they <unk> any further drop in the government 's <unk> could <unk> make this promise sound <unk>
sterling was already showing some signs of a lack of confidence in mr. lawson 's promise friday
in european trading it declined to $ N and N marks from $ N and N marks late thursday
economists suggested that if the pound falls much below N marks the government will be forced to increase rates to N N both to halt any further decline and ensure that the balance of monetary policy remains unchanged

bob stone <unk> over a letter from his manager putting him on <unk> for <unk>
mr. stone thought the discipline was unfair he believed that his manager wanted to get <unk> of him for personal reasons
unable to persuade the manager to change his decision he went to a company court for a hearing
at the scheduled time mr. stone entered a conference room in a building near where he worked
after the three members of the court introduced themselves the chairman of the panel said go ahead and tell us what happened
we may ask questions as you go along or we may wait until the end
no lawyers or tape <unk> were present
the only extra people were a couple of personnel specialists one of whom knew mr. stone 's case <unk> and would help fill in any facts needed to give the court the full picture
over a cup of coffee mr. stone told his story
he talked about N minutes
when he was through the court members asked many questions then the chairman said they would like to hear his manager 's side and talk to witnesses
the chairman promised mr. stone a decision within two weeks
bob stone is a <unk> name but the <unk> described is real
it happened at <unk> corp. in los angeles
the court is called the management appeals committee or just mac and it is likely to hear a couple of dozen cases a year
alter some details of this example and it could be taking place today at federal express in <unk> the defense and <unk> systems divisions of <unk> in minneapolis a general electric plant in columbia <unk> or a number of other companies
these firms are <unk> in a significant new trend in the corporate world the rise of what i call corporate due process
although corporate due process is <unk> today in few companies perhaps N to N it is one of the <unk> developing trends in industry
in the coming decade a majority of <unk> companies are likely to <unk> it
corporate due process appeals to management for a variety of reasons
it reduces lawsuits from <unk> employees and <unk> with all that means for reduced legal costs and better public relations
it helps to keep out unions
it increases employee commitment to the company with all that means for <unk> and quality control
what must your management team do to establish corporate due process
here are four key steps
N make sure you have a strong personnel department
it must be able to handle most of the complaints that can not be <unk> in the <unk> by managers and their <unk> else the company court or <unk> will be <unk> with cases
at polaroid the personnel policy planning committee may hear only about N cases a year the rest of the many hundreds of complaints are resolved at earlier <unk>
at <unk> the system board of adjustment <unk> N to N cases a year only a <unk> of the complaints brought to personnel specialists
at citicorp the problem review board may hear only N or so cases because of personnel 's <unk> in <unk>
in a typical year up to N N of the work force goes to personnel specialists with complaints of unfair treatment
in a large company that means many hundreds of complaints for personnel to handle
N formally or <unk> train all your managers and <unk> in the company 's <unk> approach
see that they know company personnel policy <unk> and <unk> for it is the law <unk> company courts and <unk>
<unk> them in handling complaints so that they can <unk> problems immediately
in case managers and personnel specialists are unsuccessful and <unk> take their complaints to a company court or <unk> <unk> managers to accept <unk> as a fact of business life for in a good <unk> system they are <unk> to happen
in the N companies i <unk> <unk> rates range on the average from N N to N N
N decide whether you want a panel system or a single <unk>
a panel system like that in the bob stone example <unk> such <unk> as high credibility and for the <unk> mutual support
an <unk> system that is an <unk> who acts first as a <unk> and then <unk> <unk> and <unk> the facts has such <unk> as speed flexibility and maximum <unk>
international business machines and bank of america are among the companies using the <unk> approach
N make your <unk> system visible
it wo n't do any good for anybody unless employees know about it
most <unk> <unk> to go all out in advertising their <unk> systems for fear of encouraging <unk> and <unk> <unk> to file complaints
on the other hand they make sure at a minimum that their systems are described in their employee <unk> and talked up by personnel specialists
<unk> <unk> goes further and sometimes features its <unk> <unk> in <unk> tv programs
naturally one of the best ways to guarantee <unk> for your <unk> system is for top management to support it
at ibm the company 's open door system is sometimes the subject of <unk> from the chief executive
federal express goes further in this <unk> than any company i know of with both <unk> smith and james <unk> chief executive and chief operating officer respectively sitting in on the appeals board almost every tuesday to decide cases

the u.s. is required to <unk> foreign <unk> if it knows of coup plans likely to <unk> their lives government officials said
the <unk> policy was part of a set of guidelines on handling <unk> <unk> in a secret N exchange of letters between the reagan administration and the senate intelligence committee
the <unk> of the guidelines has become known since president bush disclosed them privately to seven republican senators at a white house meeting last monday
officials familiar with the meeting said mr. bush cited the policy as an example of the sort of congressional requirements the administration contends <unk> to the failure of such <unk> actions as this month 's <unk> effort to <unk> panamanian dictator <unk> noriega
according to the officials mr. bush even read to the senators <unk> from a highly <unk> letter from the committee to the white house discussing the guidelines
they said the president conceded the <unk> <unk> did n't affect his decision to lend only minor support to this month 's panama coup effort
no <unk> was ever considered officials said apparently because the u.s. did n't think the coup <unk> intended to kill mr. noriega but merely sought to <unk> him
what 's more both administration and congressional officials <unk> that the <unk> <unk> is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being <unk> by the panel and the white house
the <unk> was launched at a meeting between mr. bush and intelligence committee leaders oct. N a few days before the meeting at which the president complained about the rules
however the disclosure of the guidelines first reported last night by nbc news is already being interpreted on capitol hill as an unfair effort to pressure congress
it has <unk> the <unk> <unk> between the white house and congress over who is responsible for the failure to <unk> mr. noriega and more broadly for difficulties in carrying out <unk> activities abroad
a statement issued by the office of the committee chairman sen. david <unk> d. <unk> charged that the disclosure is part of a continuing effort to shift the criticism for the failure of the recent coup attempt in panama
the statement added someone has <unk> chosen to <unk> <unk> <unk> of highly <unk> <unk> between the two branches of government
not only does this come close to a violation of law it <unk> the trust we have all worked to develop
sen. <unk> said it 's time to stop <unk> and work together to develop a clear and appropriate policy to help the country in the future
i 've <unk> the president to send his suggestions to the committee
republican sen. william cohen of <unk> the panel 's vice chairman said of the disclosure that a <unk> <unk> out of <unk> is a <unk> and it is unfair for those in the white house who are <unk> to present the evidence in a <unk> fashion
sen. <unk> said the committee could n't defend itself by making the documents public because that would <unk> <unk> rules
but the chairman and other committee members <unk> that the <unk> <unk> was n't imposed on the white house by a <unk> congress
instead both congressional and administration officials agreed it grew out of talks about <unk> in panama that were <unk> by the administration in july N and <unk> into last october
the <unk> was n't a law but a joint <unk> of how the u.s. might operate during foreign <unk> in light of the <unk> presidential order <unk> a u.s. role in <unk>
in fact yesterday the administration and congress were still <unk> on what had been agreed to
one administration official said <unk> was required even if the u.s. gets wind of somebody else 's coup plans that seem likely to <unk> a dictator 's life
but a congressional source close to the panel said the rule only covered coup plans directly involving the u.s.
although the <unk> <unk> was n't carried out in this month 's coup attempt some administration officials argue that it may have led to <unk> and uncertainty on the part of u.s. intelligence and military <unk> in panama
one senior administration official called the <unk> <unk> and said it could make u.s. <unk> reluctant to even listen to coup plans for fear they may get into legal trouble
the issue came to a head last year officials <unk> partly because the reagan administration had sought <unk> to win committee approval of funding for new panama coup efforts
in addition both administration and congressional officials said the need for guidelines on <unk> and <unk> was partly <unk> by a white house desire to avoid <unk> overseas <unk> during the election campaign
though the assassination ban is a white house order that congress never voted on the intelligence committees can exercise influence over its <unk>
last week central intelligence agency director william webster publicly called on congress to provide new <unk> of the assassination order that would permit the u.s. more freedom to act in <unk>
the administration has reacted to criticism that it <unk> the latest coup attempt by seeking to blame congress for restrictions the white house said have <unk> its freedom of action
however last week mr. webster 's two top cia <unk> said congressional <unk> had n't <unk> the spy agency 's role in the coup attempt in panama
nevertheless the administration 's <unk> appeared to have made some <unk> with <unk> <unk> and cohen after their oct. N meeting with the president
the three men agreed to <unk> the guidelines without changing the basic assassination ban to clear up any <unk> that may have <unk> u.s. <unk> of <unk> against <unk> leaders

yet under its <unk> president trelleborg moved aggressively into those <unk> base industries first <unk> its existing <unk> and plastics division later adding mining as well as building and construction materials

on tuesday trelleborg 's directors announced plans to spin off two big divisions minerals processing and building and distribution as separately quoted companies on stockholm 's stock exchange
at current market prices the <unk> public offerings to be completed next year would add an estimated N billion swedish <unk> $ N million to trelleborg 's <unk> analysts say

tuesday the shares <unk> <unk> closing at <unk>
mr. andersson says he is confident that taking parts of the company public will help <unk> the conglomerate <unk> that has held down trelleborg 's share price
trelleborg plans to remain the dominant shareholder with stakes of slightly less than N N of both units
the spinoff should <unk> a problem for the parent
a family foundation set up by late founder henry <unk> controls N N of trelleborg 's voting shares outstanding
but the foundation <unk> require the entire trelleborg stake to be sold in the open market if control <unk> below N N
that possibility had <unk> closer as repeated new share offerings to finance trelleborg 's rapid growth steadily diluted the foundation 's holding
that growth is the result of mr. andersson 's shopping <unk> during which he has bought and sold more than N companies during the past five years
most of the new <unk> were barely profitable if not <unk> loss makers

the treatment turned trelleborg into one of <unk> 's biggest and <unk> industrial concerns

many analysts expect mr. andersson who owns N N of the company to be named trelleborg 's new chairman when <unk> <unk> steps down next year
but the promotion is n't likely to alter a management style mr. andersson describes as being the driving force leading the troops not managing by sitting back with a <unk> waiting for people to bring me ideas
last month in his <unk> move yet mr. andersson and trelleborg joined forces with canada 's <unk> inc. in a joint $ N billion hostile takeover of another big canadian mining concern <unk> ltd

trelleborg is n't in the same league yet as mining giants such as <unk> corp. or <unk> corp. says <unk> <unk> a mining analyst at james <unk> & co. london

<unk> metals prices have <unk> trelleborg 's recent profit surge raising mining 's share of pretax profit to N N this year from a big loss two years earlier

mining is likely to remain trelleborg 's main business
analysts say its <unk> of success will likely <unk> on how well trelleborg manages to <unk> with <unk> in the <unk> venture
<unk> and trelleborg each came close to winning <unk> alone before the successful joint bid
some analysts say <unk> would prefer to break up <unk> and that the <unk> relatively <unk> in international mining operations could have problems holding their own with a much bigger partner like <unk> operating on its home <unk>
mr. andersson <unk> that trelleborg and <unk> have n't discussed a <unk> <unk>
<unk> he says will continue operating in its current form
we 'd be reluctant to accept N ownership in a manufacturing company
but such partnerships are common in mining where there are n't problems or conflict of interest or risk of <unk> by a partner trelleborg 's president says
perhaps more important both companies share mr. andersson 's belief in the coming <unk> of base industries
if the 1980s were a decade of consumption the <unk> will be the investment decade mr. andersson says
the whole of europe and the <unk> world is suffering from a <unk> in <unk> investment he says

all told there are assets on the line valued at up to $ N billion
the privatization program is designed to <unk> the government of hundreds of assets and to raise <unk> needed funds
much of the money from the sales is <unk> for a <unk> <unk> program

potential buyers mostly foreign companies are reluctant to take a <unk> stake in a company that by the government 's own <unk> needs some $ N million in new capital for <unk>
the prospect of buying into a <unk> company without getting management control <unk> at least three foreign buyers including a member of the <unk> group of australia to <unk> out of the bidding the bankers and analysts say
mr. garcia acknowledges the problem and says the asset trust will study why the bidding failed and what changes the agency may be able to offer
under government regulations however foreign ownership of <unk> 's equity is limited to N N
even though the government would retain the N N stake in <unk> critics have accused the trust of selling out to <unk>

having said that we must caution against an apparent <unk> to <unk> the case
it is not quite true for example that the <unk> government has <unk> <unk> de <unk> as mr. <unk> claims
in the same sentence he <unk> himself when he reports that the government still <unk> N N of the total equity of the airline
how can a company be considered <unk> if the state is so heavily represented in it
true the <unk> government has <unk> control over the airline to a new private <unk> but its <unk> to take back what it gives is too well known to permit one to be <unk>
<unk> too mr. <unk> resorts to the familiar numbers game when he <unk> that fewer than N state enterprises currently remain in the public sector down from the N public <unk> that <unk> in N
but the enterprises still in state hands include the biggest and most <unk> powerful ones in mexico indeed they virtually <unk> the economic <unk>

a labor-management group is preparing a revised buy-out bid for united airlines parent ual corp. that would transfer majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands according to people familiar with the group
the group has been discussing a proposal valued in a range of $ N to $ N a share or $ N billion to $ N billion
but to avoid the risk of rejection the group does n't plan to submit the plan formally at a ual board meeting today
instead the group is raising the proposal <unk> to try to test the board 's reaction
people familiar with the company say the board is n't likely to give quick approval to any offer substantially below the $ 300-a-share $ N billion buy-out bid that collapsed last week after banks would n't raise needed loans and after a key partner british airways plc dropped out
in composite trading friday on the new york stock exchange ual closed at $ N a share down $ N
but the pilots union which has been pushing for a takeover since N appears to be <unk> ahead with the revised bid to avoid further loss of momentum even though it has n't found a partner to replace british air
although the bidding group has n't had time to develop its latest idea fully or to discuss it with banks it believes bank financing could be obtained
after the collapse of the last effort the group does n't plan to make any formal proposal without <unk> commitments from banks covering the entire amount to be borrowed
under the type of transaction being discussed the <unk> group would <unk> several billion dollars from banks that could then be used to finance a cash payment to current holders
those current holders would also receive minority interests in the new company
for example the group could offer $ N a share in cash plus stock valued at $ N a share
ual currently has N million shares fully diluted
the new structure would be similar to a recapitalization in which holders get a special dividend yet retain a <unk> ownership interest
the difference is that current holders would n't retain majority ownership or control
the failed takeover would have given ual employees N N voting control of the nation 's second-largest airline with management getting N N control and british air N N
it was n't clear how the ownership would <unk> up under the new plan but employees would keep more than N N
management 's total could be reduced and the public could get more than the N N control that had been <unk> for british air
one option the board is likely to consider today is some sort of <unk> period
although the pilots are expected to continue to pursue the bid ual chairman stephen wolf may be asked to <unk> from the buy-out effort at least temporarily and to return to running the company full time
the board could eventually come under some pressure to sell the company because its members can be <unk> by a majority shareholder vote particularly since one-third of ual stock is held by takeover stock speculators who favor a sale
the labor-management buy-out group plans to keep its offer on the table in an apparent attempt to maintain its <unk> position with the board
however the only <unk> who has emerged to lead such a shareholder vote los angeles investor marvin davis who triggered the buy-out with a $ N billion bid in early august is <unk> back apparently to avoid being blamed for <unk> to the deal 's collapse
three top advisers to mr. davis visited new york late last week at least in part to <unk> with executives at citicorp
mr. davis had paid $ N million for citicorp 's backing of his last bid
but citicorp has lost some credibility because it also led the unsuccessful effort to gain bank loans for the labor-management group
on friday british air issued a statement saying it does not <unk> to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of ual in the <unk> future
however several people said that british air might yet <unk> the bidding group and that the carrier made the statement to answer questions from british regulators about how it plans to use proceeds of a securities offering previously <unk> for the ual buy-out
also late last week ual flight <unk> agreed to participate with the pilots in <unk> a revised offer
but the machinists union whose opposition helped <unk> the first buy-out bid is likely to favor a recapitalization with a friendly <unk> investor
one advantage the buy-out group intends to press with the board is that pilots have agreed to make $ N million in annual cost concessions to help finance a bid
speculation has also <unk> that the ual executive most closely identified with the failure to gain bank financing chief financial officer john <unk> may come under pressure to <unk>
however people familiar with the buy-out group said mr. <unk> 's <unk> would <unk> the airline 's management at a critical time

in east germany where <unk> has long been the only way to express political criticism they 're not <unk> about their new leader <unk> krenz
mr. krenz is such a <unk> figure that nobody has even come up with any good <unk> about him
you have to have clear <unk> about someone before you can make <unk> says an east german mother of two who <unk> <unk> political <unk> with her friends
with krenz we just do n't know what to expect
mr. krenz does n't seem to be the <unk> <unk> many initially thought he was when the <unk> politburo member was selected last week to succeed <unk> honecker
but he does n't appear to be ready to make broad changes either
according to east germany 's <unk> news agency mr. krenz <unk> to soviet leader <unk> gorbachev by telephone over the weekend and acknowledged east germany could learn from moscow 's <unk> policies
already last week mr. krenz started <unk> east germany 's heavily <unk> and <unk> <unk> news media
on thursday a day after he took office east german television broke into regular programming to launch a talk show in which <unk> call in questions for a panel of officials to answer
the regular <unk> news program and daily newspapers are also getting a visible <unk> of <unk> <unk>
it was quite a shock says a <unk> east german <unk>
for the first time in my life i was n't sure whether i was <unk> to our news or west german television
other changes including easing restrictions on travel for east germans are expected
but whether such moves can win back the confidence of east germans who have taken to the streets by the thousands in recent weeks to demand democratic changes depends largely on whether they feel they can trust mr. krenz
and that 's a problem
mr. krenz is not only closely identified with his <unk> mr. honecker but also blamed for <unk> <unk> police action against <unk> this month and for <unk> china for sending <unk> against student <unk>
i hope he grows with the job says <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> in east berlin
the most important thing is that he have a chance
although mr. krenz is <unk> to east germany 's conservative <unk> of <unk> there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party <unk>
unlike mr. honecker who <unk> to <unk> people about socialist values mr. krenz <unk> asking questions
indeed one of his first actions as leader was to visit a <unk> machine factory on the <unk> of berlin and <unk> among the workers a la gorbachev
he was later shown on television <unk> questions
at one point he asked a worker whether he thought east germans were <unk> the country because of <unk> travel policies
the worker 's <unk> <unk> it 's more than just travel
people have a sense the government is <unk> the real problems in our society
the exchange was all the more <unk> in that authorities released television <unk> to western news agencies
this same <unk> toward <unk> <unk> a group of <unk> u.s. <unk> this spring
rather than trying to <unk> us says one congressional aide who <unk> the <unk> meeting mr. krenz wanted to listen
rep. <unk> <unk> d. <unk> one of the members of the delegation says he was particularly <unk> by mr. krenz 's ready <unk> that east germany needed to change
he 's a very tough man but one who 's also open to <unk> adds an aide to west german chancellor <unk> <unk>
but there 's another side to mr. krenz
born in a <unk> town in an area which is now part of poland he has <unk> his life to the party <unk>
he moved quickly through the <unk> with the help of his <unk> mr. honecker and emerged as the <unk> apparent
<unk> <unk> an expert on east germany at radio free europe in <unk> says mr. krenz may project a <unk> image but she <unk> he 's a true <unk>
even if he is she adds he appears to have only limited room for <unk> within the communist party 's ruling politburo
against this <unk> the new east german leader must move quickly to shore up his government 's standing
the sudden growth of the opposition movement together with the steady <unk> of citizens <unk> through poland and hungary has plunged the country into its <unk> political crisis since an <unk> workers ' <unk> in N
he does n't have any <unk> period says a western <unk> based in east berlin
but if he 's sharp and quick he has a chance
the <unk> adds that mr. krenz has several things going for him
the east german economy is strong compared with other east bloc nations
and his relative <unk> could help him project a more <unk> image <unk> with the <unk> of mr. honecker as an <unk> old man
for average east germans mr. krenz remains a <unk>
either he was n't being real in the past or he is n't being real right now says a <unk> east german doctor
either way i have a problem with how quickly he 's changed
the doctor was among <unk> of people <unk> through east berlin 's <unk> church saturday morning
the walls of the church are covered with <unk> news <unk> and <unk> notes associated with the country 's political opposition
i have to come here to read the walls says the doctor because it 's information i still ca n't get through the newspapers
meanwhile east germany 's growing <unk> may even allow the <unk> news media to display a <unk> sense of <unk>
television last week carried a new report on east berlin 's main <unk> factory and the need to boost production
east germans remember a comment a few years ago by <unk> <unk> the government 's top <unk> that just because a <unk> <unk> new <unk> there 's no reason to change your own
his point was there is no reason for east germany to <unk> <unk> changes
it 's hard to know whether it was intended to be <unk> says the east berlin <unk> but everyone i know <unk> about it
the list of laboratories <unk> to be producing <unk> amounts of heat from cold fusion experiments is <unk> growing
but the experiments continue to be <unk> by lack of firm evidence that the extra heat is coming from the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
new experiments at some of the big national laboratories are still unable to find <unk> of nuclear fusion <unk> leaving only the finding of <unk> in a texas experiment to support university of <unk> <unk> ' claim of <unk> <unk> fusion at room <unk>
the latest developments in cold fusion research were presented in N reports delivered at the fall meeting here of the <unk> society the first scientific meeting in five months to hear formal reports on cold fusion experiments
the meeting offered <unk> evidence of a dramatic fall in scientific interest in cold fusion research
of the N <unk> registered for the society 's <unk> meeting fewer than N sat through the day and a half of cold fusion <unk> at week 's end
this was in contrast with the society 's meeting last may at the <unk> of the controversy when more than N scientists along with <unk> of reporters and tv <unk> <unk> into a los angeles hotel <unk> for a <unk> special night session on the subject
neither of the two <unk> whose <unk> experiments triggered the cold fusion <unk> martin <unk> and b. stanley <unk> were at the meeting
but some members of an ad <unk> expert committee set up by the department of energy to <unk> the cold fusion research were in the audience
the committee is to <unk> at the end of the month whether <unk> should support cold fusion research
most of the two dozen scientists taking the <unk> reported results with new more sophisticated <unk> of the <unk> simple <unk> experiments described last march by messrs. <unk> and <unk>
the experiments involve <unk> a thin <unk> of palladium metal with a <unk> of platinum and <unk> the two <unk> into heavy water in which the <unk> <unk> are a <unk> heavy form known as <unk>
when an electric current is applied to the palladium and platinum <unk> the heavy water did begin to break up or <unk>
<unk> the <unk> or <unk> of the water would <unk> almost all of the electrical energy
but messrs. <unk> and <unk> said their experiments also produced large amounts of heat
the heat energy plus the energy <unk> by the <unk> of the water <unk> added to far more energy coming out of the <unk> than electrical energy going in they reported
because they also <unk> <unk> and indications of nuclear <unk> they asserted that the excess heat energy must be coming from energy released by the nuclear fusion of <unk> <unk> inside the palladium <unk>
as of last weekend a dozen <unk> also have reported <unk> excess heat from similar <unk> experiments although amounts of such heat vary widely
one of the seven reports presented here of excess heat production was given by richard a. <unk> professor of chemical engineering at the university of minnesota
mr. <unk> said his <unk> of the <unk> claims was initially confirmed when his first experiments last spring failed to produce results
but he then borrowed a palladium <unk> from <unk> at texas <unk> who said they were getting excess heat
the results were <unk> he said
on the fourth run with the borrowed <unk> the experiment began producing excess heat
the experiment was stopped briefly to change an <unk>
when it was <unk> heat output really took off and produced excess heat for several hours before <unk> down he said
typical of other experiments mr. <unk> said his experiment was very <unk>
it would go along doing nothing but <unk> the heavy water and then at totally <unk> times it would begin producing excess heat for as long as N or N hours before <unk> down
the excess heat was N N to N N more than the energy involved in the <unk> of water
mr. <unk> said the heat <unk> were too large and too long to be explained by the sudden release of energy that might have <unk> <unk> during the experiments ' <unk> times as some scientists have suggested
there is a reality to the excess energy he said
other scientists said they also were getting <unk> <unk> of excess heat <unk> several hours at a time
the <unk> often <unk> they said after they <unk> the experiments by raising or <unk> the amount of electric current being applied or <unk> the current off and on
one <unk> privately suggested this <unk> that some <unk> chemical <unk> might be producing the heat
one reason questions <unk> the heat experiments is that they involve unusually <unk> <unk>
typically the <unk> energy ranges from a third of a <unk> to one <unk> and the excess energy is measured in <unk> of a <unk>
one <unk> is a continuing experiment at <unk> university where as much as N <unk> of energy are being put into the <unk> cells
a <unk> filled with heavy water is producing N to N <unk> more heat than an <unk> <unk> <unk> filled with <unk> water next to it reported <unk> m. <unk> an associate of materials scientist robert a. <unk> head of the <unk> <unk> team
one of the few <unk> the excess heat might be produced by fusion came from brief <unk> by <unk> john <unk> of texas <unk> university
mr. <unk> previously reported getting <unk> of excess heat and of <unk> increasing amounts of <unk> <unk> in the heavy water
he said that within the past few days he 's gotten evidence that there is a weak <unk> between the time the heat <unk> <unk> and the production of <unk>
there is n't any way to <unk> measure the amount of <unk> in the heavy water so it 's been difficult to tell whether the <unk> <unk> is related to the heat <unk> or some other phenomenon
increasingly <unk> attempts to measure <unk> which would be strong evidence of fusion <unk> continue to be negative
messrs. <unk> and <unk> initially reported <unk> evidence of <unk> being produced in their experiment but later conceded the <unk> were <unk>
researchers at <unk> national laboratories in <unk> <unk> reported they went so far as to take a cold fusion experiment and three <unk> detectors into a <unk> under N feet of <unk> to <unk> the detectors from <unk> <unk>
a number of times they <unk> <unk> in one sometimes two of the three detectors but only once during N hours of the experiment did they <unk> a <unk> <unk> in all three detectors and they think that was a <unk> event
<unk> <unk> of los <unk> national laboratory said researchers there <unk> a <unk> of <unk> from an early cold fusion experiment last april but decided not to announce it until they could <unk> it
in subsequent experiments one of two <unk> detectors occasionally indicated a <unk> of <unk> but <unk> <unk> were never recorded in both detectors at the same time
they concluded the indications of <unk> <unk> from <unk> in the detectors rather than from the cold fusion experiment
at the lawrence berkeley laboratory in california new experiments indicated that the <unk> added to the heavy water so it will conduct a current can produce previously <unk> electrical effects on the <unk> of the palladium <unk> which messrs. <unk> and <unk> might have <unk> reported philip ross from the california laboratory

the government reported that the number of young cattle placed on <unk> during the quarter dropped N N compared with the year-earlier quarter
many industry analysts had been <unk> a N N decline in <unk> for the quarter
in the N quarter many farmers were forced to sell their cattle to <unk> operators because the <unk> <unk> out the <unk> on their <unk>
the number of cattle moving onto <unk> in the recent quarter was also lower because <unk> cattle is less profitable
a shortage of young cattle has made them more expensive for <unk> operators to buy
the agriculture department also said that the number of <unk> cattle <unk> in the quarter dropped by N N from the N quarter which was in line with projections by analysts

it then <unk> which machine is free to do the task most quickly and <unk> the task to that machine
hewlett-packard claims that the software allows a network to run three times as many <unk> as conventional networks and will run each task twice as fast
the new hewlett-packard program said analyst john <unk> at <unk> research inc. a <unk> research company is a key building block as people move to this new model of distributed processing
in today 's computer networks some machines often sit idle while others are <unk>
with the hewlett-packard program he said you get more <unk> for the <unk> you 've spent on computers
the program which will be <unk> in january N runs on the <unk> operating system
hewlett-packard will charge $ N for a license covering N users
the program now works on all hewlett-packard and <unk> <unk> and on computers made by <unk> computer inc. of <unk> <unk>
hewlett-packard said it will sell <unk> later next year that run on sun <unk> inc. and digital equipment corp. machines
the task broker <unk> from other programs that spread computing <unk> around a network
a previously available program called network computing system developed by hewlett-packard 's <unk> division for instance takes a task and <unk> it up into parts <unk> up those parts to several computers in a network for <unk> processing
but programs in individual computers must be revised in order to work with that system

the chains used to offer <unk> during winter when business was slow but in the last year or so discounting has become a <unk> thing says donald <unk> president of <unk> group inc. a new york <unk> of grand metropolitan plc 's <unk> king chain
though <unk> 's sales are up slightly this year mr. <unk> says profits will be flat or lower
and bill <unk> a <unk> ariz. <unk> of mcdonald 's corp. who is chairman of the company 's national operators advisory board says some fast-food outlets could be in serious trouble based on the amount of discounting that seems to be going on
until recently the huge fast-food industry with sales of about $ N billion last year kept <unk> to a minimum
but early this year <unk> inc. 's <unk> bell unit and <unk> 's international inc. <unk> prices and stepped up promotions says john <unk> an analyst for <unk> <unk> & co
that brought a chain reaction in the industry
the situation was further <unk> early this month when mcdonald 's set plans to heat up the discounting by offering <unk>
it also decided to go national with <unk> which it has been <unk>
now <unk> deals on <unk> are common so are <unk> <unk> on <unk> normally priced twice as high
the discounting say fast-food operators <unk> on a scale and with a <unk> they have n't seen before
the result is that some franchisees are running hard just to stay even <unk> off middle managers and working harder to make less
<unk> <unk> a district manager for <unk> enterprises inc. a <unk> king operator in <unk> <unk> says discounting is so <unk> that we have to serve N N to N N more customers to keep sales level
it 's almost as if you 're doing extra work to give away the food he says
alan <unk> president of <unk> 's inc. an operator of <unk> 's restaurants in <unk> says all we 're doing is keeping the customers coming but we are n't increasing sales
with fast-food outlets on every <unk> he like many does n't think he has a choice in the price war our customers say that they wo n't go into a fast-food store unless they get a coupon
if the battle continues much longer many fast-food businesses will close or merge predicts <unk> <unk> who owns a string of <unk> <unk> <unk> stores in the <unk>
the industry is <unk> he says
fast-food <unk> have managed to squeeze in stores into every <unk> available
the national restaurant association says <unk> restaurant units in the u.s. rose N N to N between N and N the last year for which figures are available
with the market so <unk> says a spokesman for <unk> 's in <unk> ohio if you 're doing well you 're doing well at someone else 's expense
simply put there is n't enough business for every store to grow
according to mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> sales at <unk> <unk> 's units in the u.s. have <unk> year-earlier levels throughout N except for august
mcdonald 's has also been running negative all year the analyst says
<unk> for <unk> 's and mcdonald 's criticized mr. <unk> 's calculations
jack <unk> executive vice president and chief financial officer of mcdonald 's says the company does n't <unk> much less disclose <unk> <unk> sales
he adds that short-term <unk> can be very misleading because of differences in timing of marketing programs from year to year
profit margins at <unk> mcdonald 's outlets in the u.s. are holding up quite <unk> says mr. <unk>
profits of franchisees have n't been higher since the <unk> he adds
but mr. <unk> 's <unk> outlook is n't matched by many fast-food industry observers
smaller chains and <unk> operators will be the first to fail many in the industry predict
big franchise groups can ride out the storm a lot longer says mr. <unk> the <unk> king operator in new york
the <unk> price pressures are driving a <unk> between some <unk> and their franchisees
mr. <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> notes that most franchise owners must absorb increases in expenses without any cut in the <unk> or portion of sales that they must pay <unk>
franchisees ca n't be forced to go along with a <unk> 's discounting
but once a <unk> <unk> to a promotional program the <unk> can demand full participation to the very end says <unk> <unk> a principal of <unk> & <unk> a chicago law firm with franchise industry clients
he says courts have held that antitrust <unk> are <unk> in such cases by the need to protect consumers from <unk> marketing
in any case many franchisees in order to stay on good terms with <unk> <unk> go along with promotions
says mr. <unk> of national restaurants if you <unk> on prices maybe you would never get that telephone call about a new franchise

and you thought the only reason to save your canceled checks was to prepare for an irs audit
<unk> jackson the retired baseball star has found another use for them
mr. jackson who won the <unk> mr. october for his world series <unk> is selling some of his canceled checks to <unk> <unk> through a dealer for as much as $ N each
dealers say the <unk> trade in mr. jackson 's canceled checks is unusual
i do n't know of any living <unk> that 's ever done it says jack <unk> a dealer in <unk> <unk> and a <unk> expert in the field of baseball <unk>
an initial <unk> of mr. jackson 's checks was on sale at a <unk> show held in san francisco over labor day weekend
mr. jackson showed up at the affair to sign <unk> for a <unk> as well
for someone who has everything else <unk> 's jersey cap and cards his checks might be a <unk> addition says william <unk> owner of bill 's sports <unk> in denver who <unk> the checks at the san francisco <unk> show
for years the canceled checks of a small number of well-known baseball players have been bought and sold
but these players were dead
maybe three years ago there were a lot of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> back there were <unk> <unk> checks says mr. <unk>
however the thought of a living player selling his checks <unk> some people the wrong way
maybe i 'm a little <unk> but i would n't sell them <unk> bob <unk> owner of <unk> 's sports cards in <unk> park calif
who knows how much they 'll be worth N years from now
and mr. <unk> does n't believe they 're worth all that much now
i do n't think the checks are worth $ N <unk> he says
why mr. jackson who could n't be reached for comment has made some of his checks available for sale is n't clear
he probably has n't done it for the cash
i would say he 's <unk> not in need of money says <unk> <unk> an agent of mr. jackson 's based in new york
he has good investments
and mr. jackson probably has opened new <unk> accounts too
or at least he should
i assume those accounts are closed says mr. <unk> referring to the accounts of the canceled checks
i do n't think he 'd want to give out his current account numbers
usx corp. and its japanese partner <unk> steel ltd. agreed to form a joint venture to build a new plant to produce <unk> <unk> sheet products mainly for the automotive market
terms were n't disclosed for the plant which will have annual capacity of N tons
the move by the nation 's largest <unk> follows a string of earlier announcements by other major steel companies
<unk> steel corp. <unk> corp. and <unk> inc. all have plans to build additional lines for such <unk> <unk> steel
the surge in production analysts say raises questions about capacity <unk> demand
they note that most of the new plants will come on line in N when the current import trade <unk> program ends which could result in more imports
there 's too much capacity <unk> charles <unk> an analyst with merrill lynch capital markets
i do n't think there 's anyone not building one
he does add however that <unk> japanese car makers are boosting the levels of <unk> steel in their <unk> instead of <unk> heavily on imported steel
that trend could increase demand for <unk> <unk> sheet
the <unk> <unk> segment is one of the <unk> and most profitable segments of the steel market <unk> by all major integrated <unk> <unk> to maintain an edge over smaller <unk> and <unk> mills those <unk> off to employees
indeed usx said it expects the market for <unk> sheet steel to reach N million tons annually by N compared with N million tons <unk> in N
for the first eight months of N analysts say shipments of <unk> <unk> steel increased about N N from a year earlier while overall steel shipments were up only N N
usx and <unk> steel hope to reach a definitive agreement <unk> the N partnership by the end of the year with construction tentatively <unk> for the spring of N and production by N
usx already has six lines in existing plants producing <unk> <unk> steel but this marks the first so-called <unk> plant for such production
moreover it will boost by N N usx 's current <unk> capacity of N tons
the company said it does n't expect the new line 's capacity to <unk> affect the company 's existing <unk> <unk> lines
<unk> have also been adding capacity of so-called <unk> steel which is another way to make <unk> <unk> steel
one of the <unk> of the <unk> process is that it allows the steel to be covered with a <unk> <unk> of <unk> more quickly
once you make up your mind about an investment the rest is easy right
you just call your broker and say buy or sell
<unk> on
there are all <unk> of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a broker and just as many ways to get <unk> if you do n't know what you 're doing
so here 's a <unk> of the most common types of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity exchanges
two things to keep in mind not all exchanges accept every type of order
and even when a specific order is <unk> to an exchange a brokerage firm can <unk> to enter it for a customer
market order this is probably the most widely used order and the one most open to <unk> by <unk> floor brokers since it <unk> no price restrictions
with a market order an investor tells a broker to buy or sell at the market
it 's like saying get me in now or get me out now
for example if <unk> is being offered at $ N and bid at $ N a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price
a recent indictment alleges that some floor brokers at the two largest chicago commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers ' orders at <unk> prices by <unk> trades with fellow brokers
profits realized from these trades would then be <unk> by the <unk> brokers
limit order limit orders are used when investors want to restrict the amount they will receive or pay for an investment
investors do this by <unk> a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it
<unk> an investor wants to sell a stock but not for less than $ N
a limit order to sell could be entered at that price
one risk investors may <unk> the <unk> if the stock reaches N and then falls
unless the market goes at least one <unk> the <unk> price <unk> permitted beyond the limit price investors are n't <unk> of having their orders filled because there may not be sufficient trading volume to permit <unk> it at the specified price
stop order stop orders tell a floor broker to buy or sell an investment once the price reaches a certain level
once the price reaches that level a stop order turns into a market order and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get
stop orders are sometimes called <unk> orders because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses
while stop orders sound similar to limit orders there is a difference sell <unk> must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy <unk> above
in contrast sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below
the crash in october N and last friday 's sell-off <unk> <unk> some investors exactly what stop orders will and wo n't do
an investor who may have placed a <unk> order at $ N under a stock that was trading at $ N a share on the friday before the crash was <unk> to <unk> that the order was filled at $ N when the stock opened at that price on monday
<unk> order <unk> orders turn into limit orders when an investment trades at the price specified in the order
unlike stop orders which are filled at the market price when the stop price is hit <unk> orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price
if it ca n't be made at that price it does n't get filled
investors who wish to be out of a position without the risk of <unk> a <unk> price from a market order may use this type of order to <unk> the price at which the order must be filled
but if the market moves quickly enough it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order because the investment has passed the specified price
<unk> order <unk> orders are like stop orders in that they become market orders if a specified price is reached
however unlike a <unk> order a buy <unk> order is entered at a price below the current price while a sell <unk> order is entered at a price above it
as soon as the market trades at the specified price the floor broker will fill it at the best possible price
<unk> order the <unk> order is one of several associated with the timing of trades
it <unk> a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better
but if the investment ca n't be bought or sold immediately the order is automatically canceled
<unk> <unk> who came in second in the stock division of the recently completed u.s. trading <unk> says he uses <unk> orders almost <unk> when trading options
i like to use them to feel out the market he says
if they do n't fill it immediately then i can start over at a new price or try again with the same price
<unk> order this is another timing order
it is a market order that allows floor brokers to take more time to buy or sell an investment if they think they can get a better price by waiting
<unk> orders which are also known as <unk> the tape orders are always done at the customer 's risk
<unk> order this is really two orders in one generally for the same security or commodity <unk> floor brokers to fill <unk> order they can first and then <unk> the other order
in a <unk> market it <unk> an investor from getting stuck with having made two trades on the same security
<unk> order this type of order couples many of the orders described above with instructions that the order must be carried out at or by a certain time
on the close can be added to many types of orders
for example <unk> orders must be filled during the last few minutes of trading for the day at a price that is within the official closing range of prices as determined by the exchange
<unk> orders are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading
day orders expire at the end of the day on which they are entered <unk> orders have no expiration date
most brokers assume that all orders are day orders unless specified otherwise
on oct. N N some investors learned the consequences of <unk> <unk> limit orders and then <unk> about them
they found they had bought stock from limit orders that they might have entered weeks or months earlier and had <unk> to <unk>
it is always the responsibility of investors to keep track of the orders they have placed
investors who change their mind about buying or selling after an order has been filled are usually stuck with the consequences
mr. <unk> <unk> on the options and commodities markets for the wall street journal
in <unk> up the risks of stock-market investments there 's probably no starting place better than beta
but investors better not <unk> its <unk> either
beta is a <unk> <unk> that measures the volatility of a stock or stock mutual fund
for any given move in the overall market it suggests how <unk> that particular issue might rise or fall
beta figures are widely available and easy to <unk>
the beta of the broad market typically defined as the standard & poor 's 500-stock index is always N
so a stock with a beta of N is half as volatile one at N is N N more volatile and so on
cautious investors should generally go with stocks that have low <unk>
go with <unk> stocks to get the biggest <unk> from a bet on a <unk> market
remember though that beta also has important <unk>
beta is only part of the risk in a stock says william f. <unk> the <unk> university <unk> professor who developed the measure
there is risk that is not associated with market moves and the beta does n't tell you the <unk> of that
in particular beta does n't measure the company and <unk> risk associated with an individual stock
that business risk is very significant for an investor with only a few stocks but it virtually <unk> in a large and <unk> portfolio
beta is also a poor <unk> of the risk in stock groups that march to their own <unk>
in particular the prices of gold and other <unk> stocks <unk> up and down but the stocks tend to have low <unk> because their moves are not <unk>
concern that investors could <unk> such <unk> led the american association of individual investors to eliminate beta figures for <unk> funds in the N edition of its <unk> guide
our fear was people would look just at the beta of a gold fund and say here is an investment with very low risk says john <unk> director of research for the chicago-based group
in reality it 's very volatile but the movements are not because of market movements
ready to review the <unk> of your investment portfolio
first a <unk> <unk>
when you think of the words risk and investment what 's the specific <unk> that comes to mind
<unk> down
if you 're like most people you said it 's a holding that goes completely <unk> maybe a bond that defaults or a stock whose value <unk> in a bankruptcy <unk>
people tend to see risk primarily on that one <unk> says <unk> <unk> national director of personal financial planning for <unk> deloitte <unk> & sells
but <unk> lies another <unk> of investment risk the <unk> of <unk> your portfolio to avoid one or more types of risk and being <unk> by others
this is clearly not good news to all you people who <unk> like <unk> every night <unk> by <unk> of your money sitting <unk> in six-month cds
risk <unk> many <unk> and investments that are low in one type of obvious risk can be <unk> high in other less obvious kinds
u.s. treasury bonds for example are <unk> when it comes to returning money at maturity
but their value as investments can be <unk> by inflation which <unk> the purchasing power of bonds ' <unk> interest payments
risk is also a <unk> of time
when financial professionals measure risk <unk> they usually focus on the volatility of short-term returns
stocks are much <unk> than treasury bills for example because the range in performance from the best years to the worst is much wider
that is usually measured by the standard <unk> or <unk> of annual results from the average return over time
but investors who are <unk> with short-term <unk> may be paying too little attention to another big risk not <unk> enough money to meet long-term financial and <unk> goals
for instance some investors have <unk> off stocks since the N market crash last friday 's <unk> only <unk> those <unk>
but the stock market despite some <unk> declines has far <unk> other securities over extended periods
by <unk> to the apparent security of say money-market funds investors may not be <unk> enough investment return to pay for a comfortable retirement
that 's the biggest risk of all the risk of not meeting your objectives says steven b. <unk> a new york financial planner with seidman financial services
as a result financial advisers say they take several steps when <unk> the <unk> of clients ' portfolios
they estimate the return a person 's current portfolio is likely to generate over time along with a standard <unk> that suggests how much the return will vary year by year
they try to figure out the long-term results the person needs to meet major goals
and they <unk> types of risk that are not easily <unk>
the portfolios of two <unk> families one a couple at retirement age and another a <unk> couple at age N <unk> several types of risk that investors need to consider
for instance the insured municipal bonds that <unk> the older couple 's portfolio were probably selected in large part for their low <unk> risk
but they <unk> the holders to a lot of inflation risk and interest-rate risk
the younger couple 's <unk> involve more risk than a <unk> stock portfolio because the bulk of the money is in a single issue
note that the younger couple 's portfolio has a higher expected annual return N N vs. N N as calculated by seidman financial services which is the <unk> affiliate of <unk> seidman
that largely reflects the heavy <unk>
but one price paid for the higher expected return is greater short-term volatility as reflected in the higher standard <unk> that seidman estimates for the younger couple 's portfolio
here 's how to <unk> a standard <unk> figure take the expected return and add one standard <unk> to it
then take the expected return and <unk> one standard <unk>
in two of three years the actual result should fall within that range if all the <unk> were <unk>
then add and <unk> two standard <unk> to get a wider range
there 's a N N <unk> any year 's result will fall in the range
of course the greater volatility of the younger couple 's portfolio does n't necessarily mean those investments are <unk> in terms of meeting the holders ' long-term goals
indeed the older couple 's portfolio could actually be <unk> in that sense if the expected return wo n't generate enough dollars to meet their spending plans
they may feel <unk> secure now because they are not heavily in the stock market says john h. <unk> a financial planner with <unk> <unk> <unk> inc. in washington
but they may pay a price N or N years in the future
ms. <unk> reports on personal finance from the wall street journal 's new york bureau
when it comes to investing trying to <unk> risk and <unk> can seem like <unk> <unk> <unk> investors do n't know the actual returns that securities will deliver or the <unk> and <unk> that will <unk> along the way
looking to the past can provide some <unk>
over several decades for instance investors who put up with the stock market 's gyrations earned returns far in excess of those on bonds and cash investments like treasury bills
but while history can suggest what is reasonable to expect there 's no guarantee that the past will <unk> itself
for instance some analysts believe bond returns and volatility have moved <unk> closer to those of the stock market
and returns on cash investments may continue to exceed inflation by a wider margin than they did over the long-term past

throughout the 1980s investors have been looking for creative alternatives to traditional <unk> of financial planning
capital has been <unk> and people want in
too often however small investors are left with the same <unk> solutions that appealed to previous <unk> of <unk> <unk>
now a <unk> new approach is available to building your financial portfolio without <unk> risk without extensive planning and without <unk> your life style one bit
this is particularly good news for those who <unk> risk who are <unk> of doing extensive amounts of planning and who <unk> to see their life <unk> hurt in any way
you know who you are
my <unk> system is also <unk> for those who have tried <unk> forms of growing their currency <unk>
like all americans seeking <unk> <unk> i do find it necessary to plunge certain funds into conservative monetary tools if only to <unk> my <unk> who believes in such things
so throughout the decade i have maintained my share of individual retirement accounts and cds and <unk> with stocks bonds and mutual funds as well as <unk> my necessary position in the residential real-estate market
return on this fine portfolio has been modest when it has not been negative
figure N <unk> the performance of those businesses i 've invested in during this <unk> decade see <unk> <unk> <unk> oct. N N
<unk> properties suffered a huge decline until i <unk> <unk> of all such stocks in N at which point the industry while not <unk> up any christmas trees began a slow recovery
<unk> mutual funds remained relatively flat until i made what was for me a serious investment
by N these properties were in a <unk> causing my broker at <unk> to <unk> that she 'd never seen anything like it
concerned for her state of mind i dropped them and the market <unk> began its steady climb back to health
perhaps most dramatic was the performance of the metropolitan new york real-estate market which was <unk> until i entered it in late N at which time it posted the first negative <unk> annual growth rate in years
<unk> i cast around for a different way to plan my asset distribution and with hardly any heavy <unk> the answer struck me i was doing it already
we 've all got money to spend some of it clearly <unk> since we keep <unk> of it
bank it

<unk>
daily living is the best possible investment
your <unk> may be different but here in figure N is where i 've chosen to build for the future personal space automotive <unk> children 's <unk> <unk> equipment <unk> and <unk> and finally entertainment perhaps the best investment of all
all have paid off for me in <unk> annual growth and continue to provide significant potential
at least according to my calculations
personal space figure N has grown N N annually over the course of the decade a performance that would <unk> <unk> with an investment in say <unk> products for the <unk> of <unk> vehicles which my <unk> got into and sort of <unk> to this day
the <unk> of expensive children 's <unk> that i have purchased <unk> at a host of <unk> brokerage firms figure N has increased <unk> in total asset value far beyond any personal investment except perhaps for my record collection whose worth i think it 's safe to say is <unk>
continued investment in my N <unk> has been part of my strategy figure N with present annual contributions now <unk> more than N N of the car 's original value
according to my calculations these <unk> should have brought the value of my <unk> to more than $ N on the open market figure N where i plan to offer it shortly
expansion of my living space has produced an obvious need for maintenance and construction of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to its suburban <unk>
i have thus committed sufficient personal <unk> to ensure that my <unk> and <unk> will never be short of <unk> and <unk>
my initial stake in this <unk> enterprise has grown <unk> according to my conservative calculations
at the same time my share in a wide variety of entertainment <unk> has given perhaps the most dramatic <unk> of the benefits of creative personal financial planning
over the course of the decade for instance my return on investment in the area of <unk> alone figures <unk> and <unk> has been most <unk> showing <unk> annual expansion with given the way my associates play no sign of <unk> into the 1990s and beyond
with this personal strategy <unk> in place i look forward to years of fine <unk> investments and increasing widespread <unk>

henry <unk> watch out
mr. schwartz is a business executive and writer in new york
when james schwartz was just a <unk> his father gave him a piece of career advice
he told me to choose an area where just by being <unk> i could be great recalls mr. schwartz now N
he tried management consulting traded in <unk> for a while and even managed professional <unk>
now he has settled into a career that <unk> the bill financial planning
it should be noted that mr. schwartz who operates out of <unk> <unk> is a <unk> sort who <unk> to give his colleagues the <unk>
but in this case the <unk> has a very sharp point
though it 's probably safe to assume that the majority of financial planners are <unk> and even <unk> <unk> the fact remains that as one <unk> puts it anybody who can <unk> a <unk> can call himself a financial planner
planners now influence the investment of several hundred billion dollars but in effect they operate in the <unk>
there is no effective <unk> of planners no accepted standard for <unk> into their <unk> a <unk> got into one trade group no way to <unk> their performance no way even to know how many of them there are estimates range from N to N
all anyone need do is <unk> up a <unk> and start planning
so it should come as no shock that the <unk> if that 's what it is has attracted a lot of people whose principal <unk> seem to be <unk> away or <unk> <unk> their clients ' money
<unk> state and federal authorities are trying to <unk> ways to <unk> and <unk> planners
industry groups and <unk> planners who are members of them want <unk> standards too they 're <unk> of seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> in the business press as <unk> than <unk> and <unk> than a <unk> of <unk>
but reform has n't taken hold yet
the industry is still pretty much in its wild west days says scott <unk> director of investor education for the north american securities <unk> association
an <unk> limited survey by <unk> whose members are state <unk> regulators found that between N and N fraud and <unk> by financial planners cost N investors $ N million
the <unk> ' <unk> of planners involved includes some convicted <unk> a <unk> <unk> or two various <unk> who had planned their own previous ventures right into bankruptcy and one man who <unk> his wife 's <unk>
what 's more the losses they and the others caused are just what we are <unk> over says mr. <unk> adding that the majority of <unk> probably go <unk>
so do just about all the losses that could be attributed to the <unk> <unk> of <unk> planners
nobody can estimate the toll but john <unk> a <unk> fla. planner and head of one trade group the international association of registered financial planners thinks the danger to investors from <unk> is <unk> far greater than that from <unk>
his group like others wants minimum standards applied to all who call themselves financial planners
<unk> all this some people now think the best planner might be no planner at all
for most investors the benefits just are n't worth the risks says <unk> <unk> who follows <unk> issues for the consumer <unk> of america a <unk> organization based in washington
she concedes that such a position is unfair to the thousands of <unk> and <unk> people <unk> the trade but as a consumer <unk> she <unk> <unk> to take it
she says her group used to give <unk> on <unk> planners check educational and experience <unk> <unk> regulators and better business <unk> but found that even some people who took these steps were still getting <unk> off
the bad news however has n't been bad enough to kill the growing demand for financial planning
the tax reform act of N which eliminated many tax <unk> <unk> by planners and the stock market crash the next year did cause a sharp slump in such demand and many planners had to make an <unk> <unk> from the business
but membership in the international association of financial planners <unk> the industry 's biggest trade group is still nearly <unk> what it was in N and it 's believed that the <unk> of planners who do n't <unk> to any group have soared as well
an estimated N million americans are now using financial planners and the pool of capital they influence is enormous
a survey of N of them conducted by the <unk> in april showed that these <unk> alone had controlled or <unk> the investment of $ N billion of their clients ' money in the previous N months
the <unk> number of planners makes the business extremely difficult if not impossible to <unk>
even the minority of them who must <unk> with the securities and exchange commission as investment advisers people who are in the business of <unk> others on the buying and selling of securities specifically have been enough to <unk> the agency 's capacity
the sec has only about N <unk> assigned to keep <unk> on investment advisers about the same as in N even though the number of advisers has <unk> to about N over the past decade
currently a registered investment adviser can expect an sec audit only once every N years
a lot of bad things can happen in N years
it does n't take a <unk> scientist to figure out our problem says <unk> <unk> director of the sec 's division of investment management
so the sec has proposed to congress that much of the job of <unk> be turned over to an <unk> <unk> organization <unk> on the national association of securities dealers which operates in the brokerage business
such an organization could among other things set minimum standards for <unk> ethics and <unk> and <unk> those investment advisers who broke the rules
the proposal has set off a <unk> debate within an industry that was far from united to begin with
mr. schwartz the <unk> planner from <unk> <unk> says that allowing the business to police itself would be like putting <unk> in charge of the blood bank
mr. <unk> the <unk> planner who heads one trade group <unk> simply <unk> the industry and giving the money to the sec to hire more staff
mr. <unk> 's views are not <unk> with wild <unk> over at the <unk> the major industry organization

that may be because mr. <unk> <unk> at what he considered <unk> on his membership standards made by the rival group <unk> his <unk> <unk> as a member of the <unk>
then he sent the <unk> 's picture with the <unk> of membership it was made out to <unk> <unk> <unk> to every newspaper he could think of
the states have their own ideas about <unk> and <unk>
<unk> the organization of state securities regulators is pushing for a model regulatory <unk> already adopted in eight states
it requires financial planners to <unk> with states pass <unk> tests and <unk> to customers any <unk> of interest
the most common conflict <unk> compensation
<unk> estimates that nearly N N of planners receive some or all of their income from sales commissions on securities insurance and other financial products they <unk>
the issue is the planner putting his clients into the best investments or the ones that <unk> the biggest commissions
in N the new york attorney general 's office got an order from a state court in <unk> <unk> down first <unk> corp. an <unk> <unk> firm that had invested $ N million on behalf of nearly N investors
in its notice of action the attorney general said the company had promised to put clients into <unk> investment portfolios instead the attorney general alleged the company consistently <unk> <unk> customers into high-risk investments in <unk> <unk> and florida <unk>
those investments paid big commissions to first <unk> payments investors were never told about the attorney general alleged
investors were further <unk> that only those with a <unk> net worth would be accepted
in practice the attorney general alleged in an <unk> if an investor had access to cash the <unk> of being turned down by first <unk> were about as <unk> as being rejected by the <unk> club
and the attorney general added first <unk> 's president roger v. <unk> <unk> himself as a financial expert when his <unk> largely <unk> of a <unk> <unk> work as a real-estate and insurance salesman and a <unk> as <unk> at a highway toll <unk>
first <unk> and its officials are currently under investigation for possible criminal <unk> according to a spokeswoman for the attorney general
harry <unk> mr. <unk> 's attorney says his client <unk> any <unk> and adds that the attorney general 's <unk> about first <unk> 's business practices are <unk>
as for mr. <unk> 's <unk> the <unk> attorneys for the state of new york decided mr. <unk> was n't <unk> because he did n't have a harvard degree says mr. <unk>
civil suits against planners by clients seeking recovery of funds are increasingly common
two such actions both filed earlier this year in georgia state court in atlanta could be particularly <unk> to the industry both name j. chandler peterson an atlanta financial planner who is a founder and past chairman of the <unk> as <unk>
one suit filed by more than three dozen investors charges that mr. peterson <unk> much of the $ N million put into a limited partnership that he operated and <unk> spending some of it to pay his own legal bills and to invest in other companies in which he had an interest
those companies in turn paid mr. peterson commissions and fees the suit alleges
the other suit was filed by two men in a dispute over $ N investments each says he made with mr. peterson as part of an effort to purchase the bank of <unk> in <unk> <unk>
one <unk> a doctor <unk> in an <unk> that he also gave mr. peterson $ N to join a sort of investment club which essentially gave the <unk> the <unk> of making additional investments with mr. peterson
in <unk> each <unk> claims mr. peterson promised the bank purchase would be completed by the end of N or the money returned
mr. peterson took the plaintiffs ' and other investors ' money to a meeting of the bank 's directors
wearing a business suit and <unk> <unk> and <unk> he opened up his <unk> and dumped $ N million in cash on a table in front of the directors says <unk> <unk> the bank 's president
he said he wanted to show the color of his money recalls mr. <unk>
bank officials however showed him the door and the sale never came off
according to the suit mr. peterson has yet to return the plaintiffs ' investment
they want it back
mr. peterson declines to comment on specific allegations in the two suits saying he <unk> to save such <unk> for court
but he does say that all of his activities have been entirely <unk>
on the suit by the limited partners he says he is considering a <unk> suit against the plaintiffs
the suit he adds is almost in the nature of a <unk> by a handful of <unk> people
<unk> the suit over the bank bid mr. peterson says it is filled with <unk> language and half <unk>
he declines to go into <unk>
mr. peterson says the suits against him are less a measure of his work than they are a sign of the times in which people generally are more <unk> to <unk>
i do n't know anybody in the industry who has n't experienced litigation he says
mr. peterson also says he does n't consider himself a financial planner <unk>
he now calls himself an investment banker
in many scams or alleged scams involving planners it 's <unk> that only a <unk> of common sense on the part of the investors would have kept them out of <unk> 's way
using it would n't a <unk> <unk> to pay <unk> of thousands of dollars just for a chance to invest <unk> planner
other cases go to show that an old saw still <unk> if it sounds too good to be true it probably is
certificates of deposit do n't pay N N a year for example but that did n't give <unk> to clients of one <unk> planner
now they 're losers and he 's in jail in <unk> county
cds yielding N N are even more <unk> especially when the <unk> bank in the marshall islands is merely a mail drop watched over by a local <unk> operator but investors fell for that one too
and the colorado planner who promised to make some of his clients <unk> on investments of as <unk> as $ N
never mind
you already know the answer
mr. <unk> is a staff reporter in the wall street journal 's los angeles bureau
at the <unk> fashion island shopping center the <unk> and <unk> <unk> of this <unk> southern california beach community <unk> from their <unk> and <unk> for another day of <unk> their credit cards
they <unk> among the <unk> offerings at <unk> and <unk> <unk>
they <unk> through the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> court
they <unk> at the farmers market a combination <unk> food court and <unk> store while a <unk> <unk> the <unk> fashion show with a <unk> of <unk> <unk>
the <unk> look of <unk> <unk> the show 's <unk> slightly <unk> in its influence
meanwhile in the <unk> office buildings that <unk> fashion island the odds are good that someone is getting <unk>
<unk> authorities say that at any given time a host of <unk> <unk> operations <unk> with the many legitimate businesses here
they seem to like these industrial <unk> says <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> who <unk> in mail fraud
we call them fraud farms
<unk> to that <unk> of <unk> known as newport beach
this city of more than N is known for <unk> <unk> and rich residents
it is also known as the fraud capital of the u.s. dubbed by investigators and the media as the <unk> de fraud
how does a community famous for its high living end up as a haven for <unk>
clearly the <unk> of the former <unk> the <unk>
the places <unk> for <unk> <unk> like the miami neighborhood known as the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 's <unk> strip of <unk> <unk> offer fast cars high <unk> <unk> women and lots of <unk>
you do n't hear much about unusual <unk> of fraud in green bay or <unk>
<unk> men <unk> <unk>
newport beach <unk> the <unk> artists ' <unk> <unk>
what more could a <unk> man in search of the easy life ask for
nothing seems hard here
the <unk> are soft the waves <unk> <unk> and the <unk> trees <unk> <unk>
<unk> is <unk>
moreover <unk> is <unk>
the <unk> price of homes is $ N more than N <unk> fill what the chamber of commerce calls the nation 's largest <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> mr. <unk>
that 's what they 're after
the rich image of newport beach also helps lend the <unk> artists ' operation an air of <unk>
one reason they use newport beach is that it sounds <unk> than most <unk> says david katz a u.s. attorney who until recently headed a <unk> southern california fraud task force
newport beach is known in <unk> island for having a lot of rich people
no wonder all kinds of <unk> scams have <unk> here from <unk> <unk> <unk> sales to <unk> car dealers to <unk> <unk> traders
but above all this is the national headquarters for <unk> operators those <unk> <unk> salesmen who use the telephone to <unk> money from the <unk> and the <unk> and then <unk>
because only a <unk> of them are ever <unk> nobody really knows how much money <unk> <unk> operators really <unk>
i 've heard that there is $ N billion taken in nationwide by boiler rooms every year mr. <unk> says
if that 's true orange county has to be at least N N of that
and most of the truly big scams in orange county seem to <unk> in newport beach or one of the other <unk> <unk> that <unk> this <unk> city that <unk> around a point of land on the california coast south of los angeles
in fact sophisticated <unk> <unk> scams are known <unk> among <unk> types as newport beach operations
that <unk> with the <unk> sales of things such as <unk> sets and office supplies that are known as hollywood scams
newport beach <unk> concentrate on precious metals and <unk> deals that typically cost thousands of dollars a shot
the investors range from elderly <unk> to <unk> professionals
in one <unk> recent example of a newport beach boiler room <unk> investors in capital trust inc. were <unk> told that their investment in precious metals was insured against losses caused by employees due to <unk> <unk> or <unk> according to an indictment <unk> up by a federal grand jury in los angeles last month
thus <unk> <unk> investors sent $ N million to the newport beach company most of which was <unk> to <unk> uses the indictment charges
douglas jones an attorney representing richard <unk> <unk> <unk> the chairman and president of capital trust says his client <unk> that there was any attempt to <unk> investors
there were some business deals that went bad mr. jones says but no intent to <unk>
newport beach operations <unk> from the hollywood boiler rooms in style as well as in dollars
traditionally boiler rooms operate on the cheap since few if any customers ever visit their offices
indeed the name <unk> from the <unk> among <unk> <unk> to <unk> cheap <unk> space near the boiler room
but says mr. katz the u.s. attorney the interesting thing about newport beach operations is that they give themselves the <unk> of <unk> offices with <unk> <unk>
when we go there it 's quite different from these hollywood places where the <unk> are spread out on the table and the people are <unk> their <unk>
the newport beach operators also tend to <unk> themselves privately
investigators <unk> the case of <unk> <unk> who is currently serving a <unk> sentence at <unk> federal prison for his role in <unk> investment corp. which promised investors returns of as much as N N on precious metals
mr. <unk> who pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud in federal court in los angeles drove a <unk> <unk> and lived in an expensive home on <unk> <unk> an island in newport 's <unk> according to investigators
with the $ N million received from investors he took <unk> <unk> with friends to <unk> <unk> and <unk> an expensive <unk> for his <unk> whom he met at the shop where he got his <unk> suits
it 's <unk> the amount of money that goes up their <unk> out to the <unk> track or to the <unk> in <unk> <unk> mr. katz says
all this talk of boiler rooms and fraud is <unk> to the city 's legitimate business <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> regional manager of property management systems <unk> he does n't know of any <unk> <unk> operating in the N million square feet of office space around fashion island that his company <unk> for <unk> co. the owner and developer of the project
mr. <unk> has rejected a few <unk> <unk> who provided <unk> financial information and acknowledges that <unk> operators are not easily <unk>
investigators stress that building owners are victims too since boiler rooms often leave without paying <unk>
richard <unk> president of the newport <unk> area chamber of commerce calls boiler rooms a negative we wish we could get <unk> of
actually we do n't get much negative publicity about this he <unk> except for the press who write about it
mr. <unk> is deputy chief of the wall street journal 's dallas bureau
you went to college and thought you got an education
now you <unk> that you never learned the most important <unk> how to send your kids to college
true when you went to college there was n't that much to learn
stick some money in an <unk> account and watch it grow
now investment salesmen say it 's time to take some risks if you want the kind of returns that will buy your <unk> a ticket to <unk> <unk> in N years
in short throw away the <unk> and go for the <unk>
the reason is cost
nothing in the <unk> of tuition <unk> parents for the 1980s
<unk> at private <unk> rose N N in the N years ended in june of this year that 's twice the N N increase in consumer prices for the same period
a year at harvard now goes for $ N
by N when this year 's <unk> hit <unk> a <unk> <unk> league <unk> will cost $ N give or take a few <unk> at <unk> time
<unk> <unk> and other <unk> will cost no less
so what 's a parent to do
some investment advisers are <unk> in effect a bet on a start-up investment pool maybe even on margin
others prefer <unk> zero-coupon bonds
still others say why not take a chance on a <unk> growth fund
you 're not going to make it in a N N bank account says james <unk> director of mutual funds at t. rowe price
to get the necessary growth adds <unk> <unk> a marketing official at the financial programs <unk> group you need to go to the stock market
in other words a little volatility never hurt
it never hurt anyone that is unless the growth funds do n't grow when you need them to
or the zero-coupon bonds turn out not to have been <unk> deeply enough to pay your <unk> 's tuition
that 's the <unk> for today 's parent
although many experts are advising risk no one has a good answer for you if the risk does n't pay off
help may be on the way
the antitrust division of the justice department is investigating the <unk> similar tuition charges and increases among the top schools
fear of the price police could help cool things off in the 1990s
and then there 's always state u
but parents ' <unk> for a <unk> education for their children is growing like their <unk> for <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> aware of public concern lawmakers and financial middlemen are working <unk> to create and sell college savings and investment <unk>
their message <unk> or <unk> is that a good college will cost so much by <unk> you want it that the tried and true wo n't do <unk>
<unk> about treasury bills or a money-market fund
the latest wave of marketing is <unk>
several <unk> including the financial programs franklin and t. rowe price <unk> groups and the edward d. jones brokerage house are advertising college planner <unk> and <unk> that tell you how much you need to put aside <unk>
the calculations generally rely on an after-tax rate of return of N N annually a rate <unk> <unk> by the individual in only one place the stock market
most of the <unk> are free but <unk> financial programs sells for $ N a version <unk> to the age of the child and the college of choice
the figures are <unk>
to build a <unk> egg that would pay for <unk> when a current <unk> reaches college age parents would need to set aside $ N a month for N years
they can cut this to $ N a month if the investing <unk> up through college
and they can further reduce the monthly amount if they start <unk> earlier when mother and child come home from the hospital
<unk> a cheaper college into the <unk> still does n't generate an <unk> most people can live with
using a recent average <unk> cost of about $ N a year t. rowe price 's planner <unk> $ N monthly if the plan begins when the child is six
since the formula <unk> an N N <unk> return in a mutual fund there would also be $ N in taxes to pay over the N years
not everyone is so <unk>
people are <unk> <unk> a lot of fear says arthur <unk> a consultant to the american council on education in washington
he takes issue with projections that do n't factor in students ' own contribution which reduces most parents ' burden substantially
still he says it 's no bad thing if all the marketing <unk> people into putting aside a little more
the situation you want to avoid is having somebody not save anything and hope they 'll be able to do it out of current income he says
that 's <unk>
his advice do n't panic
parents he says should aim at whatever regular investment sum they can afford
half the amount that the investment <unk> suggest might be a good goal he adds
that way parents will reduce <unk> and <unk> from current income when the time comes to pay tuition
mr. <unk> <unk> that the best investment choice is mutual funds because they are managed and over time have nearly kept up with the broad stock <unk>
he <unk> either an <unk> fund or a <unk> fund that <unk> both stocks and bonds
in their anxiety however parents and other student <unk> are <unk> to new <unk>
they have <unk> out about $ N billion for so-called <unk> zero-coupon municipal bonds so far offered by connecticut illinois virginia and eight other states
and they have bought about $ N million in <unk> plans offered in michigan florida and <unk>
the <unk> plans take payment today usually at current <unk> or at a slight discount for a promise that tuition will be covered tomorrow
the <unk> bonds <unk> offered in small <unk> and usually <unk> a provision that they wo n't be called before maturity seem to be <unk> for college <unk>
like other <unk> they pay all their interest at maturity meaning that buyers can time things so that their bonds pay off just when <unk> <unk> from high school
their <unk> effect is also <unk>
in june virginia sold bonds for $ N that will pay $ N in N
but richard anderson head of the <unk> for college financing alternatives at columbia university a research group partly financed by the federal government says <unk> are particularly <unk>
their price falls further than that of other bonds when inflation and interest rates <unk> up
that wo n't matter if they are held to maturity but if for any reason the parents need to sell them before then there could be a severe loss of principal
had <unk> been available in N and had parents bought a face amount equal to four years ' tuition at the time <unk> for their children 's N <unk> they would have been left with only enough to pay for two years mr. anderson figures
most other bonds however would probably not have <unk> much better
the <unk> plans may be a good bet provided the guarantee of future tuition is secure
<unk> states generally limit the guarantees to <unk> institutions however and buyers get <unk> without much interest if the children do n't <unk> the specified schools
two private groups are seeking securities and exchange commission approval for plans that could be more broadly <unk>
mr. anderson wants the <unk> <unk> to <unk> such a plan
the issue here may be the <unk> of the guarantee
<unk> much like <unk> purchases are <unk> for investment
<unk> are naturally <unk> on their ability to keep ahead of tuition inflation with investment returns
but buyers are essentially <unk> on a start-up investment fund with no track record and some have been encouraged to <unk> to do so
one problem is that the internal revenue service has decided that the investment earnings and gains of the <unk> ' funds are <unk>
the <unk> as educational institutions had hoped that would n't be the case
based on <unk> rates of return mr. anderson <unk> a N N stock portfolio <unk> to the market would have kept up with tuition and taxes in the <unk> century
but <unk> might not pick the stocks that will match the market
and they 're <unk> more toward fixed income whose returns after tax have <unk> tuition increases
i 'm not sure they 're going to make it work says mr. anderson
what <unk> if the <unk> do n't have the cash to pay the <unk>
florida and <unk> have backed up their guarantees with the full <unk> and credit of the state governments meaning that taxpayers will pick up any <unk>
not so michigan
its plan is set up as an independent agency
the state says there 's no worry investment returns combined with fees and the gains from <unk> plans will provide all the cash it needs
mr. <unk> covers education from the wall street journal 's boston bureau
if you start <unk> for your child 's <unk> on jan. N N here 's the monthly sum you will need to invest to pay for four years at <unk> <unk> <unk> and university of minnesota

he also <unk> a lot of back taxes interest and civil fraud penalties
a lot of taxpayers out there are n't as <unk> as one might think
federal and state tax <unk> develop many group targets for investigation on the basis of <unk> high income type of income or some other <unk> that may signal an opportunity or <unk> to <unk> income or <unk> deductions
many <unk> long have seemed to be targets because of the <unk> or <unk> efforts of some members to offset high income with <unk> losses from <unk> tax <unk> <unk> who invested in <unk> dubbed foreign <unk> or airline pilots who raised <unk> on their days off
<unk> ministers have been <unk>
now television and radio <unk> are under <unk>
the irs recently won part of its <unk> battle with the church of <unk> over <unk> when the u.s. supreme court held that members ' payments to the church were n't <unk> because the members received services in return
irs statistics show that the more <unk> <unk> of income among sole <unk> of businesses include <unk> dealers entertainment producers <unk> <unk> and <unk> owners
small businesses in general account for almost N N of <unk> personal income the irs has said
once such <unk> become so <unk> the irs <unk> another factor into its secret computer formula for <unk> returns for audit and does n't need special projects for them
san <unk> have a much higher <unk> of <unk> than average because more of them <unk> high under that formula not because irs agents <unk> their life <unk>
many <unk> for mass <unk> such as <unk> tax <unk> and home offices have <unk> so broadly that congress has passed <unk> laws to close them
deductions of <unk> <unk> of highly valued art now must be <unk> by <unk>
and laws requiring the reporting of more <unk> of transactions have <unk> the irs to rely on computers to <unk> out <unk> with returns and to generate <unk> inquiries to taxpayers
<unk> <unk> income can be <unk> by computer because a <unk> of <unk> who gets a deduction must report the former <unk> 's social security number
<unk> <unk> now must give social security numbers <unk> the irs to see whether americans living abroad are filing required u.s. returns
but while irs computers focus <unk> on target groups like these the agency has assigned many agents to special projects that need more personal attention
in most cases the irs says these projects are local or regional rather than national and <unk> because <unk> in an area <unk> some pattern of <unk> among say factory workers <unk> that having a <unk> of <unk> <unk> them from tax <unk> or <unk> owners <unk> losses from <unk> <unk> businesses
the national office currently has N <unk> audit projects according to marshall v. <unk> deputy assistant commissioner for <unk>
<unk> involved in <unk> projects ca n't send anyone to jail but they can make life <unk> in other ways for one by <unk> some of the N different civil penalties for <unk> failure to file a return and the like
the <unk> audit groups include direct sellers people who sell <unk> <unk> and other items door to door or at home parties and employers who <unk> workers as independent contractors instead of employees to avoid the <unk> share of payroll taxes
other projects look for <unk> among <unk> who get cash <unk> people who <unk> in large cash transactions and people whose returns show they sold a home for a profit without <unk> the capital gain in another home by the end of the same year the gain must be <unk> over within two years to <unk> tax
and now that returns must show <unk> ' social security numbers the irs wants to see which <unk> show up on more than one return and which <unk> turn out to be <unk>
<unk> for the <unk> project came from a congressional hearing some years back
it prompted an irs study that found many sellers were <unk> income and <unk> large amounts of <unk> travel and other personal expenses as business costs mr. <unk> says
the study provided <unk> for <unk> out returns of potentially <unk> taxpayers who report low income and large expenses from a <unk> business
the tax court recently denied business deductions by mr. and mrs. peter s. <unk> of <unk> hill n.j. who both were <unk> <unk> of <unk> products in addition to their regular jobs as sales people in other fields
for N they reported gross income of $ N from <unk> sales offset by expenses totaling $ N including car costs of $ N and travel and entertainment costs of $ N
the tax court did n't believe that the <unk> who earned $ N in their regular jobs <unk> the <unk> as a real business and <unk> merely <unk> <unk> of <unk> and other personal <unk> and benefits from it
the direct selling association a trade group points out that its members which include <unk> corp. <unk> with the irs to distribute <unk> material to sales people and are helping to prepare a <unk> television program on the subject
the <unk> project which began in N <unk> about N irs agents
in the fiscal nine months ended june N reports raymond p. <unk> assistant commissioner for collection they <unk> about N employers <unk> more than $ N million in <unk> employment taxes and <unk> about N workers as employees instead of <unk> contractors
the number of <unk> workers may be in the millions mostly paid by small firms
many workers especially professionals want to remain independent to avoid tax <unk> and to continue to <unk> many expenses that employees ca n't
but many others who want to qualify for employee benefits and unemployment compensation become <unk> for the irs says jerry <unk> who manages the irs project 's force of nine agents in north and central florida from <unk>
firms that are paying employment taxes also provide leads to competitors that are n't he says
in his area mr. <unk> continues the <unk> employers most <unk> are in construction doing <unk> <unk> <unk> and similar work
but a medical <unk> with about N employees <unk> listed all of them including <unk> and <unk> as independent contractors
the irs <unk> the <unk> $ N in back payroll taxes
it <unk> nearly $ N against a <unk> company that carried about N <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other employees as <unk> <unk>
<unk> states also are becoming more aggressive <unk> of tax <unk> and perhaps none <unk> them down with more <unk> than does new york since it acquired an $ N million computer system in N
the state 's tax <unk> have <unk> data <unk> from other new york agencies that license or <unk> professionals and businesses from exchange agreements with the irs N other states and two canadian <unk> and even from <unk> <unk> pages
thus <unk> for massive matching of documents by computer they single out <unk> groups looking primarily for people who have n't filed new york <unk> returns
the state has <unk> through records relating to <unk> <unk> lawyers in the new york city area construction workers from out of the state and homeowners who claim to be residents of other states especially florida which has no personal income tax
soon to feel the <unk> of attention are lawyers elsewhere in the state doctors <unk> and <unk> says <unk> g. <unk> director of the <unk> division that <unk> the <unk> programs
the department has <unk> over $ N million from brokers so far and recommended more than N of them for criminal <unk>
in the early stage of <unk> people with <unk> exceeding $ N who were filing <unk> returns it squeezed $ N million out of a man who was <unk> as a florida <unk>

mr. <unk> is editor of the wall street journal 's tax report <unk>
in finding good news in berkeley 's new <unk> <unk> plan the <unk> class editorial sept. N you 're reading the <unk> but not the story
the plan indeed raises from N N to N N the number of <unk> <unk> admitted <unk> by academic <unk>
but that does n't mean half of the students <unk> berkeley will be admitted this way
the plan is talking about <unk> admitted not students who <unk>
since the yield from this top <unk> of <unk> is relatively low boosting admits from N N to N N will boost <unk> from about N N to N N of the class
in addition perhaps N N of <unk> will come from a new category consisting of <unk> whose academic <unk> narrowly <unk> <unk> them <unk> in the first category
but against that combined increase of N N in students chosen by academic <unk> the plan <unk> a large category in which <unk> now are based on <unk> test <unk> and <unk> points for factors such as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and an <unk>
this category now accounts for about N N of admits and N N of <unk>
the plan thus will <unk> by N N for a net loss of N N the number of students admitted primarily by academic <unk>
who will take over these places
the plan <unk> a new category of students from <unk> <unk> <unk> a concept not yet defined and gives them about N N of the class
one of the plan 's <unk> has <unk> the <unk> <unk> category as perhaps making more sense than the current <unk> <unk> based on race
perhaps it does
but the new category does not replace or reduce berkeley 's broad racial <unk>
nor will students from <unk> groups who are admitted through the new category be <unk> against the <unk> target for their group
the plan thus places a large new <unk> program based on <unk> <unk> on top of the existing program based on race
the role of academic <unk> in <unk> berkeley 's <unk> can only decline as a result
stephen r. <unk> professor of law university of california berkeley calif
for those who <unk> in the <unk> of others read on
this is a story about <unk>
most of us know a <unk>
many of us are <unk>
but what we may not know is just what makes somebody a <unk>
what makes people <unk> out their credit-card numbers to a <unk> they 've never heard of
do they really believe that the number is just for <unk> and is simply a <unk> on the road to being a <unk> <unk>
what makes a person buy an oil well from some <unk> <unk> on the screen door
or an interest in a retirement community in <unk> that will <unk> your <unk> off once it is built
because in the end these people always wind up asking themselves the same question how could i be so <unk>
there are unfortunately plenty of <unk> to that question and <unk> artists know all of them
these people are very <unk> at finding out what makes a person <unk> says <unk> <unk> chief of the <unk> unit of the <unk> county state attorney 's office in <unk> <unk> fla. a major haven for boiler rooms
once they size them up then they know what <unk> to push
john <unk> <unk> and he ought to know
he used to be a <unk> salesman <unk> investments in oil and gas wells and <unk> <unk>
there 's a <unk> psychology of the sale and different <unk> you <unk> different ways he says
the most obvious <unk> of course is the <unk> of big returns
we 're all a little <unk>
everyone is vulnerable says charles <unk> associate regional <unk> for the securities and exchange commission in miami
these guys <unk> on human <unk>
while the promises of big profits ought to set off warning <unk> they often do n't in part because <unk> <unk> have become <unk> in american <unk>
the overnight success story is part of our culture and our society puts an <unk> on it with <unk> and <unk> <unk> making <unk> out of people says michael <unk> an associate professor of psychology at the university of <unk> in louisville
other people are making it overnight and the rest who <unk> daily do n't want to miss that opportunity when it seems to come along
adds <unk> <unk> branch chief for enforcement at the sec in <unk> worth texas why do people play the <unk> when the odds are great against them
people are <unk> for a <unk>
clearly though <unk> artists have to be a bit more <unk> than simply promising millions the psychology of <unk> is n't simply the psychology of the <unk>
there 's also for instance the need to be part of the <unk>

fox <unk> has been defined as the <unk> in pursuit of the <unk> but at least it 's exercise
at least it has a little <unk>
most of us have to spend our time on <unk> that afford neither <unk> duties rather than <unk>
like trying to buy life insurance for instance an <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
call it the <unk> <unk> after the <unk>
but <unk> or later most of us have to think about life insurance just as we often have to think about having <unk> work
and my time has come
i 'm N married no children and <unk> in writing stories like this one
in times past <unk> salesmen <unk> heads of household meaning men but <unk> is a <unk> family and <unk> to it
so if anything happened to me i 'd want to leave behind enough so that my <unk> husband would be able to pay off the mortgage and some other debts though not i <unk> enough to put any potential second wife in the <unk> of luxury
<unk> that maybe $ N to $ N would do but having no idea of what kind of policy i wanted i looked at the <unk> products of a dozen companies and plunged into a <unk> of <unk>
over the past decade or two while i was thinking about fox <unk> the insurance industry has <unk> an <unk> number of products <unk> on products and <unk> on the <unk>
besides term life and whole life the old <unk> we now have universal life universal <unk> life <unk> adjustable universal life policies with <unk> bonuses policies <unk> with <unk> <unk> living benefit policies and on and on
what to do
first <unk>
<unk> of all their <unk> special provisions and other <unk> and <unk> insurance policies can still be <unk> under two broad categories so-called <unk> insurance which <unk> no cash value in the policy and pays off only upon death and permanent insurance which provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that can be used in various ways while the insured is still alive
if all you want is <unk> coverage <unk> insurance a term policy gives you maximum <unk> for your <unk> within limits
it 's much cheaper than permanent insurance bought at the same age
but term means just that the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it expires
it may also <unk> that the insured must pass another medical <unk> before <unk> if you <unk> which means you need insurance more than ever you may not be able to buy it
even if you 're healthy and can <unk> your premium will go up sharply because you 're that much older
so term insurance may not be as cheap as it looks
there are all <unk> of <unk> on term insurance policies <unk> to pay off your mortgage debt term <unk> <unk> on to permanent insurance and many others
one <unk> that appealed to me at first was the money <unk> term life policy offered by amex life insurance co. the american express unit to the parent company 's credit-card holders
upon <unk> however i <unk> whether the plan made a lot of sense
amex said it would charge me $ N a year for $ N of coverage and would pay me back all the premiums i put in if i canceled the policy after N years
sounds great or does it
first if i canceled i 'd have no more insurance a not <unk> consideration
second the $ N i 'd get back would be much <unk> in purchasing power by N years of inflation amex not i would get the benefit of the investment income on my money income that would have exceeded the inflation rate and thus given the company a real profit
third and most important amex would charge me a far higher premium than other <unk> companies would on a straight term policy for the same amount i 'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that i 'd almost have to <unk> to make the whole thing <unk>
that would be all right with amex which could then <unk> in its investment profit but it does n't add up to a <unk> money move for me
which goes to show that the first law <unk> in insurance as in anything else there is no free lunch there is only marketing
and the second law <unk> to insurance
if i die early i win a <unk> victory since i ca n't <unk> it and if i live long the insurer <unk>
always
this is worth <unk> when insurers and their salesmen try to sell you permanent insurance the kind that <unk> cash value
the word death can not be <unk> entirely by the industry but salesmen <unk> it <unk> possible or <unk> it in <unk> <unk> to talk about savings and investment instead
the <unk> is that your <unk> policy is really some kind of cd or <unk> account with an added <unk>
that is <unk> the <unk>
the fact is that as a savings or investment vehicle insurance generally runs a poor second to any direct investment you might make in the same things the insurance company is putting your money into
that 's because you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package
again no free lunch
this is reflected in a <unk> mortality cost in effect your share of the company 's estimated liability in paying off beneficiaries of people who had the <unk> to die while under its protection
and in most cases a huge <unk> of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is in effect paying the salesman 's commission as well investment returns on most policies are actually negative for several years largely because of this
so view permanent insurance for what it is a compromise between <unk> insurance and direct investment
the <unk> most traditional form of permanent insurance is the straight whole life policy
you pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage the company <unk> that premium in a portfolio of its <unk> and your cash value and dividends grow over the years
one <unk> <unk> so called <unk> life you pay for the whole policy at once has been <unk> popular in recent years for tax reasons the insured could <unk> cash value in the form of policy loans and none of the proceeds were <unk> even though they included gains on investment
congress closed this <unk> last year or thought it did
however <unk> capital corp. of <unk> mass. has developed a combination plan of <unk> and insurance coverage that it says does not <unk> the new regulations and that allows policy loans without tax consequences
but the percentage of your cash reserve that you can <unk> <unk> is very small
i 'm not prepared in any case to put that much money into a policy immediately so i look into the broad category called universal life
<unk> popular it is far more <unk> than straight whole life
i can <unk> the amount of insurance i want against the amount going into investment i can pay more or less than the so-called target premium in a given year and i can even <unk> payments if my cash reserves are enough to cover the insurance portion of the policy
in looking at these and other policies i learn to ask pointed questions about some of the <unk> built into policy <unk> the <unk> of numbers that show me the <unk> of my cash values over the years
they <unk> give two <unk> one is based on interest rates that the company guarantees usually N N to N N and the other on the rate it is currently getting on investment often N N or more
<unk> the <unk> over several decades i find my cash <unk> is <unk> but can any high interest rate <unk> for that long
not likely i think
also some policy <unk> assume that mortality costs will decline or that i will get some sort of dividend bonus after the <unk> year
these are not certain either
companies are n't comfortable playing these games but they realize they 're under pressure to make their policies look good says <unk> <unk> an <unk> consultant at <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> co. the big new york consulting firm
another factor to consider some of the companies currently <unk> very high yields are doing so through substantial investment in junk bonds and you know how nervous the market has been about those <unk>
there are <unk> <unk> <unk> to universal life and it pays to ask questions about all of them
at a <unk> <unk> for example a friend <unk> that she 'll only have to pay premiums on her john <unk> policy for seven years and that her death benefits will then be guaranteed
i call her agent david <unk>
yes he says premiums on such <unk> coverage can be <unk> to <unk> after a certain period but usually only if interest rates stay high enough to generate sufficient cash to cover the annual cost of insurance protection
if interest rates plunge the insurer may be <unk> on my door asking for <unk> premium payments to maintain the same amount of protection
i do n't like the sound of that
some insurers have also started offering <unk> bonuses such as extra dividends or a <unk> higher interest yield if the policy is maintained for N years
but <unk> daily a new york-based financial consultant <unk> that many of these bonuses are just <unk> because most are n't guaranteed by the companies
and the <unk> is so new he adds that no insurer has yet established a track record for actually making such payments
so-called <unk> provisions also <unk> a close <unk>
offered by insurers that include <unk> life insurance co. jackson national life insurance co. and national travelers life insurance co. these policy <unk> let me <unk> a portion of my death benefits while i 'm still alive
some provisions would let me <unk> a percentage of the policy 's face value to pay for long-term care such as <unk> <unk> others would allow payments for <unk> <unk> and conditions such as cancer heart <unk> <unk> failure and <unk> <unk>
but the <unk> events for which the <unk> can <unk> are narrowly defined vary from policy to policy and generally permit use of only a small <unk> of the face amount of insurance
also financial planners advising on insurance say that to their <unk> there has not yet been a tax ruling <unk> these advance payments from taxes
and considering the extra cost of such provisions some figure that people interested in say paying for extended <unk> care would be better off just buying a separate policy that provides it
i 'm more <unk> <unk> by <unk> life even though it turns out to be <unk> life
<unk> selling these policies market them directly to the public or otherwise do n't use <unk> salesmen there is still a load annual administrative fees and initial <unk> charges but i figure that the lack of commission and of <unk> fees for dropping the policy early still <unk> me a lot
i compared one universal policy for $ N face amount from such an insurer american life insurance corp. of lincoln <unk> with a similar offering from <unk> life <unk> society of the u.s. which operates through N <unk> salesmen
after one year i could walk away from the <unk> policy with $ N but <unk> get only $ N from the <unk>
the difference is <unk> by time too
at age N when i 'd stop paying premiums the <unk> offering would have a projected cash value $ N higher than the other even though the <unk> 's policy <unk> assumed a <unk> higher interest rate
did i buy it
well not yet
i 'm thinking about using the $ N annual premium to finance a <unk> to paris first
a person can do some heavy thinking about insurance there and shop for something more <unk> while she 's doing it
<unk> group inc. will report that third-quarter profit rose more than N N from a year earlier though the gain is <unk> due to asset sales robert <unk> chairman president and chief executive officer said

when his <unk> avenue fur business here was flying high N years ago jack <unk> had N workers and a large factory
now his <unk> employees work in an <unk> shop that he says is smaller than his old storage room
he also says he is losing money now
he <unk> imports
but just down <unk> avenue where about N N of u.s. fur <unk> are made <unk> rosen has acquired two retail outlets <unk> his <unk> line and expanded into <unk>
he credits imports
the difference lies in how the two <unk> furriers reacted to the foreign competition and <unk> of their industry over the past N years
one stuck to <unk> business <unk> while the other <unk> the change
the small good fur <unk> is not what it used to be says mr. <unk> N years old
we make the <unk> product in the world and the americans are being <unk> around
mr. rosen though believes imports have <unk> the industry in which he has worked for most of his N years
you 've got some <unk> here that wo n't think <unk> he says
import competition for u.s. furs has risen sharply since furriers started aggressively marketing <unk> <unk> and similar <unk> imported furs in recent years
merchants discovered a consumer largely ignored by <unk> furriers the younger woman even in her late <unk> who never thought she could buy a <unk>
the new market helped boost u.s. fur sales to about $ N billion a year now <unk> the level in the late 1970s
it also opened the door to furs made in south korea china hong kong and other countries
<unk> furs a large south korean maker says it operates N retail outlets in the u.s. and plans to open N more by the end of next year
mr. <unk> and other <unk> furriers call many of the the imports <unk> and poorly made
<unk> u.s. furriers say these imports have n't squeezed them
but <unk> and <unk> furriers like mr. <unk> who once <unk> the <unk> <unk> avenue fur district say imports have cut their sales
a woman who once would have <unk> for two or three <unk> to buy a <unk> <unk> can now get an imported <unk> right away for less than $ N
yet mr. rosen has turned the import phenomenon to his advantage
early in the decade he saw that fur workers in many foreign countries were willing to work longer hours at lower <unk> than their american <unk> and were more open to <unk>
in N he started a factory in <unk>
two years later he opened one in west germany
he also noticed that foreign makers were <unk> many <unk> on the traditional fur and he decided to follow suit
by <unk> his <unk> in <unk> and quality control with the lower costs of production abroad he says he has been able to produce <unk> goods at low cost
to maintain control over production and avoid <unk> on foreign sources he says he still makes most of his furs in the u.s.
but six years ago he also began <unk> from the far east
<unk> by imports mr. rosen now makes fur <unk> <unk> and <unk>
this year he produced a men 's line and offers <unk> furs in red <unk> red <unk> royal blue and forest green
he has <unk> <unk> from turkey that are <unk> with <unk> <unk> and topped off with <unk> <unk>
from asia he has <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> made by using different <unk> furs
next he will be testing <unk> <unk> called <unk> made in the far east
he plans to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
besides adding to sales <unk> also attract retailers who may buy furs later he adds
other furriers have also benefited from <unk>
<unk> <unk> the <unk> owner of <unk> <unk> furs inc. <unk> the reverse side of a <unk> <unk> to produce a <unk> <unk> <unk>
he says it accounts for N N of total sales
mr. rosen is also pushing retail sales
this year he bought two stores one in <unk> and one in <unk>
other furriers have also placed more weight on retailing
golden <unk> furs inc. began retailing aggressively eight years ago and now retail sales account for about N N of gross income
in other moves mr. rosen says he bought a truck three years ago to reach more retailers
since then he has expanded his fleet and can now bring his furs to the front door of retailers as far away as the <unk>
small retailers who ca n't afford to travel to his new york <unk> have become fair game
such moves have helped mr. rosen weather the industry slump of recent years
the industry <unk> six <unk> years beginning in N but since N sales have <unk> at their $ N billion peak
large furriers such as <unk> inc. fur <unk> inc. and evans inc. all reported losses in their latest fiscal years
<unk> of the N stock market crash head the list of reasons
in addition competition has <unk> the market with both <unk> and <unk> driving prices down
the <unk> movement has n't helped sales
<unk> <unk> over the past two years have <unk> demand too furriers <unk>
and those who did n't move some production overseas suffer labor <unk>
the <unk> labor needed to <unk> furs in the u.s. is not as available as it was says mr. <unk> who is starting overseas production
but even those who have found a way to <unk> with the imports and the slump fear that furs are losing part of their <unk>
people are promoting furs in various ways and taking the <unk> out of the fur business says stephen <unk> <unk> merchandise manager for marshall field 's department store in chicago
you ca n't make a commodity out of a luxury <unk> mr. <unk> the new york <unk>
he contends that <unk> consumers with <unk> imports will <unk> the industry in the long run by reducing the <unk> of furs
but mr. rosen <unk> whatever people want to buy i 'll sell

an olivetti spokesman said the company 's factories are already beginning to produce the machine and that it should be available in europe by december

the new chip is a very big step in computing and it is important that olivetti be one of the first out on the market with this product said <unk> <unk> davis an analyst at james <unk> & co. in london

ms. davis said the new machines could <unk> some sales away from olivetti 's own <unk> but would bring new sales among professionals such as engineers <unk> and medical doctors
although olivetti 's profits tumbled N N in the first half of this year she believes olivetti 's restructuring last fall and its <unk> of new products will begin to bear fruit with an earnings rebound next year especially if it can <unk> its promise to deliver the new machines by december
we think the worst is over in the european <unk> market she said
depending on the type of software and <unk> used the machines can serve either as the main computer in a network of many <unk> a role usually filled by a <unk> as a technical <unk> or as a very fast personal computer
it 's the missing link in olivetti 's product line between small personal computers and <unk> <unk> the olivetti spokesman said

we 've done a lot to improve u.s. results and a lot more will be done mr. mark said
<unk> profitability of u.s. operations is an extremely high priority in the company
colgate 's results were at the high end of the range of analysts ' forecasts
the <unk> of the improvement in the u.s. business caught some analysts by surprise
the company 's domestic business especially its household products division has performed poorly for years
analysts say the earnings improvement came from cutting costs rather than increasing sales
for the nine months net increased N N to $ N million or $ N a share
sales rose N N to $ N billion
the company earned $ N million or $ N a share in the year-earlier period

at&t said third-quarter net income grew despite <unk> competition in all of the company 's markets
net income rose to $ N million or N cents a share from the year-earlier $ N million or N cents a share
revenue edged up to $ N billion from $ N billion
the latest period 's net was reduced $ N million or nine cents a share for a change in <unk> method and <unk> changes in estimates of <unk> lives and net <unk> for certain telecommunications equipment
the results roughly matched estimates of securities analysts who were encouraged by at&t increasing its operating margin to N N from N N a year ago because of continued <unk> efforts
sales of long-distance services an extremely competitive market rose N N

managers who retire dec. N will have an additional N N added to their monthly pension for as long as five years or age N <unk> comes earlier

but other analysts expressed <unk> that the <unk> move wo n't result in even greater earnings growth
this is a good move but it only gets you to where people 's expectations already are in terms of earnings growth said <unk> d. gross an analyst with donaldson lufkin & jenrette
mr. gross said he had hoped that a cost savings of $ N million would result in even greater growth than the N N annual earnings increase at&t has told analysts it expects in the future
at&t said the special retirement option will increase fourth-quarter expenses
but the company said the amount ca n't be determined until it knows how many managers <unk> to retire

indexing for the most part has involved simply buying and then holding stocks in the correct mix to <unk> a stock market <unk> such as standard & poor 's 500-stock index and match its performance
institutional investors have <unk> $ N billion into stock and bond indexing as a cheap and easy form of investment management that promises to post average market returns

and the fees investors pay for indexing run a few <unk> for each $ N of assets a <unk> of the cost of active managers
that 's because computers do most of the work and low trading activity <unk> a <unk> on commission costs
but today indexing is moving from a passive investment strategy to an increasingly active one
because <unk> managers are no longer <unk> with merely being average they have developed enhanced indexing strategies that are intended to <unk> the market as much as three percentage points
indexing has been the most single successful investment concept in the last decade but the index money has been just sort of sitting there says <unk> m. <unk> president of <unk> core investors inc. an <unk> based in <unk> <unk>
now the interest is in what else can i do with that money
among the <unk> indexing strategies <unk> portfolios can be built around thousands of stocks or just a few dozen rather than being restricted to the s&p N companies
they can <unk> the s&p N stocks <unk> and focus on particular types of stocks such as smaller companies those paying high dividends or companies in a particular industry state or country
with today 's <unk> program trading <unk> index funds can trade back and <unk> between stock-index futures and the actual stocks making up <unk> such as the s&p N
futures and options also make it possible to build <unk> index funds that do n't actually own a single share of stock but can produce returns that match or exceed the broad stock market
one reason for these <unk> is that indexing 's rapid growth is slowing particularly for those <unk> <unk> funds that <unk> the s&p N
there is n't a <unk> of big investors out there still waiting to get into indexing says p. james <unk> vice president of <unk> investment management co. chicago which offers both indexing and active management services
after <unk> in size in the past five years index funds now hold about N N of the stock owned by pension funds
a further problem is <unk> profits
<unk> funds have become so <unk> that fees they can charge have plunged to almost nothing and in some cases are just that
to land customers for their <unk> stock <unk> business big banks sometimes will throw in basic indexing services for free
it 's like getting a free <unk> when you open an account says <unk> core 's mr. <unk>
as a result <unk> have been looking for ways to give investors something more than the average for their money
and many have been successful as in the case of the index fund operated by <unk> <unk> capital
<unk> capital has used enhanced indexing <unk> to beat the s&p N 's returns by N to N percentage points over the past four years with the same risk level as holding the s&p N stocks according to james <unk> the firm 's president
strategies vary for <unk> capital which has $ N million under management
the firm sometimes buys s&p N futures when they are selling at a discount to the actual stocks and will <unk> back and <unk> between stocks and stock-index futures to take <unk> of any <unk> price <unk>
mr. <unk> also goes through periods when he buys stocks in <unk> with options to boost returns and protect against declines
and in some months he buys stock-index futures and not stocks at all
by their nature our trades are very short-term and are going to create high turnover mr. <unk> adds
the more turnover the better for our clients
big <unk> bankers trust co. also uses futures in a strategy that on average has added one percentage point to its enhanced fund 's returns
j. thomas allen president of <unk> advanced investment management inc. <unk> it 's a good idea to jump between the s&p N stocks and futures
you 're buying the s&p and you always want to hold the <unk> form of it he says
but some <unk> make little or no use of futures saying that these instruments present added risks for investors
if the futures markets have a problem then those products could have a problem says john <unk> managing director of prudential insurance co. of america 's investment index technologies inc. unit
prudential currently is seeking approval to offer a new fund offering a return equal to the s&p N index plus N of a percentage point
an added <unk> is that the <unk> improved return would be guaranteed by prudential
there are many other strategies to bolster the returns of index funds
they include
limited risk funds
these guarantee protection against stock market declines while still passing along most gains
here a fund may promise to pay back say $ N of every $ N invested for a year even if the market goes much lower
the fund could invest $ N for one year in treasury bills yielding N N to return the guaranteed $ N
that leaves $ N which could be used to buy s&p N options that will nearly match any gain in the s&p index
manager <unk> funds
say a big investor is interested in growth stocks
instead of hiring one of the many active managers <unk> in growth stocks <unk> can design a portfolio around the same stocks the portfolio will be maintained by computer reducing both fees and in theory risk because of the large number of stocks
we see a lot of interest in those kind of things says frank <unk> a vice president of bankers trust
people comfortable with the passive approach are using them for other strategies
<unk> funds
this is an index fund with a bet
instead of <unk> the s&p N or some other index exactly some stocks are <unk> or <unk> in the portfolio
one simple approach is to exclude s&p N companies considered bankruptcy candidates this can avoid weak <unk> but also can hurt when a company like chrysler corp. <unk>
another approach an investor with $ N million might use $ N million to buy the s&p N index and spend the other $ N million on a favorite group of stocks
<unk> funds
<unk> can be <unk> to serve social goals such as eliminating the stocks of companies doing business in south africa
other funds have been designed to concentrate on stocks in a <unk> area in order to encourage local investment
pennsylvania state employees retirement system for example has about $ N million invested in a fund of N companies that are either <unk> or have N N of their work forces in the state

amex short interest has been <unk> upward since <unk> with increases in each month since then except at <unk>
traders who sell short <unk> stock and sell it <unk> that the stock 's price will decline and that they can buy the shares back later at a lower price for return to the <unk>
short interest is the number of shares that have n't yet been purchased for return to lenders
although a substantial short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock 's price will decline some investors consider an increase in short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually must be bought back
<unk> in short interest of certain stocks also may be caused partly by <unk>
the figures occasionally include <unk> transactions in restricted stock
the level of negative sentiment measured by the big board short interest ratio slipped to N from last month 's N
the ratio is the number of trading days at the exchange 's average trading volume that would be required to convert the total short interest position

once the plan is approved <unk> <unk> <unk> said most of bank <unk> 's nonperforming loans will have been fully provided for and the bank will be on track to report a pretax profit of between <unk> N million and <unk> N million for the fiscal year ending march N
for the previous financial year the bank would have reported a pretax profit of <unk> N million if it had n't made provisions for the nonperforming loans he said
malaysia 's banking <unk> act <unk> the bank from <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk>
but public documents indicate N N or more of the bank 's provisions were made for <unk> interest on a <unk> N million loan to malaysia 's dominant political party the united <unk> national organization to build its <unk> and headquarters complex in <unk> <unk>
the loan to <unk> was made in september N
we <unk> a lot of money all over the place said <unk> <unk> <unk> who refused to discuss the bank 's outstanding loans to
as well as the <unk> N billion in provisions announced on oct. N the restructuring package covers an additional <unk> N million in provisions made in earlier years but never reflected in a reduction of the bank 's <unk> capital
at the end of the exercise the cash <unk> from <unk> will increase the bank 's <unk> capital to <unk> N billion after virtually being <unk> out by the new provisions

white N years old a <unk> in her church <unk> she <unk> a generation that gave its heart and its vote to ronald reagan
i felt kind of safe she says
no longer
when the supreme court opened the door this year to new restrictions on abortion ms. <unk> opened her mind to democratic politics
then a political <unk> she stepped into a <unk> of pro-choice <unk> house parties and <unk>
now she leads a <unk> abortion-rights campaign in <unk> county for pro-choice democratic <unk> candidate james florio
this is one where i cross party lines she says <unk> the anti-abortion stance of rep. florio 's <unk> <unk> rep. james courter
people my age thought it was n't going to be an issue
now it has especially for people my age
polls bear out this warning but after a decade of increased republican influence here the new politics of abortion have contributed to a world turned <unk> down for mr. courter
unless he <unk> the gap republicans risk losing not only the <unk> but also the assembly next month
going into the 1990s the gop is paying a price for the same conservative social <unk> that it used to <unk> democrats in the past
this change comes less from a shift in public opinion which has n't changed much on abortion over the past decade than in the <unk> of the debate
new jersey 's own highest court remains a liberal <unk> against major restrictions on abortion but the u.s. supreme court ruling webster vs. missouri has engaged voters across the nation who had been <unk> from the issue
before july pro-choice voters could <unk> make political decisions without focusing narrowly on abortion
now the threat of further restrictions adds a new <unk> bringing an <unk> in political activity by abortion-rights forces
a recent pro-choice rally in <unk> drew thousands and in a major <unk> congress is <unk> a presidential veto and <unk> that <unk> abortions be permitted in cases of rape and incest
if webster had n't happened you would n't be here <unk> <unk> tells a reporter in the <unk> office of the national organization for women
we could have <unk> from the <unk> about courter and no one would have heard us
new jersey is a <unk> ground for this aggressive <unk> movement this year
the <unk> of activists can bring a <unk> of <unk>
in <unk> hill the national abortion rights action league whose goal is to sign up N pro-choice voters targets a union <unk> to build labor support for its cause

a year ago this fall new jersey voters under N <unk> george bush by N N to N N over michael <unk> according to a survey then by <unk> university 's <unk> institute
a matching <unk> star <unk> poll last month showed a complete <unk>
voters in the same age group backed democrat florio N N to N N over republican courter
abortion alone ca n't explain this shift but new jersey is a model of how so personal an issue can become a <unk> of <unk> in <unk> a candidate
by a <unk> ratio voters appear more at ease with mr. florio 's stance on abortion and polls indicate his lead <unk> when the candidates are specifically linked to the issue
the times are my times says mr. florio
the <unk> county congressman still carries himself with a <unk> <unk> <unk> but at a <unk> in <unk> 's <unk> day <unk> recently he was <unk> with his wife in the middle of the avenue in the city 's old <unk> <unk>
after losing by fewer than N votes in the N governor 's race he has prepared himself <unk> for this moment including deciding in recent years he could no longer support <unk> on federal funding for <unk> abortions
if you 're going to be <unk> and say it is a <unk> protected right he <unk> how are you going to say an <unk> woman who can drive to the hospital or <unk> in a <unk> car has a constitutional right and someone who is not in great shape financially does not
mr. courter by comparison seems a shadow of the confident <unk> who <unk> <unk> north before national <unk> at <unk> hearings two years ago
looking back he says he <unk> by <unk> his personal opposition to abortion instead of <unk> voters that he would n't <unk> his views on policy as governor
it is a <unk> that <unk> neither side in the debate
he does n't know himself <unk> <unk> of the abortion rights league says of mr. courter 's position
even abortion opponents however angry with mr. florio ca n't <unk> their <unk> with the republican 's <unk>
he does n't want to lead the people says richard <unk> president of new jersey right to life
moreover by <unk> outside the state 's pro-choice <unk> mr. courter <unk> fears that he is too conservative as well on more <unk> concerns such as auto insurance rates and the environment
he hurt himself further this summer by bringing <unk> issues into the debate and by <unk> on this issue and abortion he has weakened his credibility in what is already a <unk> campaign on both sides
elected to congress in N the <unk> mr. courter is part of a generation of young conservatives who were once very much in the lead of the <unk> shift under mr. reagan
like many of his colleagues he did n't serve in vietnam in the <unk> yet <unk> a <unk> defense and foreign policy even voting against a N resolution critical of the u.s. mining of <unk> <unk>
jack kemp and the writers <unk> <unk> and george <unk> were <unk> and mr. courter 's own conservative <unk> proved <unk> to the current new jersey gop governor thomas <unk> in the N republican primary here
the same partnership is now crucial to mr. courter 's <unk> but the abortion issue is only a <unk> of the gap between his record and that of the more moderate pro-choice gov. <unk>
while the <unk> county congressman <unk> an <unk> <unk> <unk> in washington gov. <unk> was <unk> increased income and sales taxes at home and <unk> a near doubling in the size of new jersey 's budget in his eight years in office
<unk> forces play down any differences with mr. courter but this history makes it harder for the conservative to run against government
mr. courter 's <unk> plan to bring down auto insurance rates met criticism from gov. <unk> 's own insurance commissioner
mr. courter is further <unk> by a record of votes opposed to government <unk> on behalf of consumers

he is <unk> and <unk> before a puerto <unk> congress in <unk> park

consumer prices rose a surprisingly moderate N N in september pushed up mostly by a jump in clothing costs the labor department reported
energy costs which drove wholesale prices up sharply during the month continued to decline at the retail level <unk> down transportation and helping to ease housing costs
the report was the <unk> news the financial markets had seen since before the stock market plunged more than N points last friday
the dow jones industrial average rallied on the news closing N points higher at N
bond prices also jumped as traders appeared to read the data as a sign that interest rates may fall
but many economists were not nearly as <unk>

we 've had <unk> declines in consumer energy prices in each of the past three months and at the wholesale level those are fully behind us now said <unk> <unk> chief domestic economist at bankers trust co. in new york
because wholesale energy prices shot up by a steep N N last month many analysts expected energy prices to rise at the consumer level too
as a result many economists were expecting the consumer price index to increase significantly more than it did
but retail energy prices declined N N in september
though analysts say competition will probably hold down increases in retail energy prices many expect some of the wholesale rise to be passed along to the consumer before the end of the year
still some analysts <unk> that the worst of the inflation is behind
it increasingly appears that N was a temporary inflation <unk> and not the beginning of a cyclical inflation problem argued edward <unk> chief economist at prudential-bache securities inc. in new york
in both N and N consumer prices rose N N
a <unk> in world oil prices last winter sent consumer prices <unk> at a N N annual rate in the first five months of this year but the subsequent decline in energy prices has pulled the annual rate back down to N N
mr. <unk> predicted that world business competition will continue to <unk> prices
the bottom line is it seems to me that the economic environment has become very very <unk> for a lot of businesses he said
back in N business was operating at fairly tight capacity so businesses felt they could raise prices
now he said a slowdown in economic activity has <unk> demand
the <unk> inflation figures renewed investors ' hopes that the federal reserve will ease its interest-rate stance
the steep climb in producer prices reported last friday <unk> <unk> about lower interest rates and contributed to the stock market 's N N plunge that day
in the past several days however the u.s. 's central bank has allowed a key interest rate to fall slightly to try to <unk> the markets
analysts say fed policy makers have been wary of <unk> credit too much because they were still uncertain about the level of inflation in the economy
excluding the volatile categories of energy and food leaving what some economists call the core inflation rate consumer prices still rose only N N in september
transportation costs actually fell N N and housing costs gained only N N
apparel prices <unk> up N N but that was after three months of declines
medical costs continued their steep <unk> rising N N after four consecutive months of N N increases
car prices another area that contributed to the steep rise in the wholesale index last month still showed declines at the consumer level
they dropped N N as dealers continued to offer <unk> to attract customers
food prices rose N N for the second month in a row far slower than the monthly rises earlier in the year
separately the labor department reported that average weekly earnings rose N N in september after <unk> for inflation following a N N decline in august

across the country resorts are using everything from <unk> to <unk> <unk> to attract new customers
some have built health <unk> business centers and shopping <unk> so visitors have more to do than ski
and this week the industry 's efforts will go national for the first time when it <unk> a $ N million advertising campaign
such efforts <unk> of only a few years ago are the latest attempts to revive the <unk> $ N billion u.s. ski industry
since the start of the decade <unk> sales have grown only N N a year on average compared with N N annual growth rates in the <unk> and <unk>
last season <unk> sales fell for the first time in seven years
by some estimates nearly a fourth of all u.s. ski areas have been forced to shut down since the early <unk>
competition and <unk> insurance and equipment costs have been the <unk> of many resorts
but another big problem has been the <unk> of baby <unk>
<unk> after all has mainly been for the young and <unk> and many baby <unk> have <unk> <unk> or have too many family <unk> to stick with the sport
in its new ad campaign created by <unk> <unk> <unk> & <unk> inc. chicago the ski industry is trying to change its image as a sport primarily for young white people
one <unk> tv spot features a <unk> group of <unk> <unk> <unk> down <unk> <unk> senior citizens minorities families with children even a <unk> <unk>
ski school is great <unk> out a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> as he <unk> down a <unk> <unk>
you 'll never know <unk> you try says a black <unk>
we used to show some <unk> <unk> in his <unk> or <unk> going over the edge of a <unk> says <unk> <unk> a spokeswoman for the united ski industries association the trade group <unk> the campaign
ski promotions have traditionally avoided the <unk> issue of safety
but the new <unk> deal with it <unk> by showing a woman <unk> as she tries to get up from a fall
we wanted to show it 's <unk> if you fall says ms. <unk>
most people think if you <unk> you 'll wind up in a body cast
the ad campaign represents an unusual <unk> of cooperation among resorts and ski equipment makers normally they only run ads <unk> their own products and facilities
but in these <unk> times for the ski industry some resorts such as the <unk> fire red river and <unk> ski areas in new mexico have even started <unk> <unk> to each other 's <unk> and next year plan to sell <unk> good for all local <unk>
many resorts also are focusing more on the service side of their business
since N N of <unk> are parents many <unk> are building <unk> expanding ski schools and adding entertainment for kids
<unk> <unk> now has a <unk> that looks like an old mining town kids can ski through and pan for <unk> 's gold
for $ N they can <unk> their own <unk> entertainment with <unk> without <unk> and <unk>
a few years ago parents usually had to hire a <unk> or take turns <unk> while one <unk> stayed with the children
most parents who had to go through that never came back says michael <unk> president of <unk> associates inc. which owns and operates the <unk> and nearby <unk> <unk> resorts
to make <unk> more <unk> for <unk> visitors several resorts are buying or starting their own travel agencies
in one phone call ski <unk> can make hotel and restaurant <unk> buy <unk> <unk> <unk> ski equipment and sign up for <unk>
and resorts are adding other <unk> such as <unk> restaurants health <unk> and <unk> packages with a <unk>
during winter carnival week for example visitors at sunday river in <unk> can take a <unk> <unk> ride
people these days want something else to do besides ski and sit in the bar says don <unk> executive director of <unk> fire <unk> 's chamber of commerce
the ski industry hopes to increase the number of <unk> by N million to about N million in the next five years with its latest ads and promotions
but some think that 's being <unk> optimistic
for one thing it may be tough to attract people because <unk> is still expensive a <unk> ticket can cost up to $ N a day and equipment prices are rising
and most <unk> still prefer a <unk> climate for their winter <unk>
an american express co. survey of its travel agents <unk> that only N N believe their clients will pick a <unk> this winter based on the <unk> of winter sports as opposed to N N who think that <unk> sports will be the deciding factor
even if they could bring in that many new <unk> i do n't know if the industry could handle that kind of an increase says <unk> william berry editor and publisher of the ski industry letter in <unk> <unk>
most people will come on the weekend the <unk> will be <unk> and then these new <unk> wo n't come back
they did n't play the third game of the world series on tuesday night as scheduled and they did n't play it on wednesday or thursday either
but you knew that did n't you
they are supposed to play the game next tuesday in <unk> park here
the theory is that the stadium damaged by tuesday 's earthquake will be <unk> by then and that people will be able to get there
like just about everything else that remains to be seen
aftershocks could <unk>
but at least the law of <unk> should have <unk> to the favorable side
it may seem <unk> to worry about the world series amid the <unk> to the bay area <unk> by tuesday 's quake but the name of this <unk> is on sports so i feel <unk> to do so
you might be interested to know that baseball not <unk> appeared to be the first thought of most of the crowd of <unk> that had <unk> at <unk> at N p.m. tuesday a <unk> before game time when the quake struck
as soon as the <unk> passed many people <unk> <unk> and <unk> as though it had been a novel kind of <unk> show
one <unk> <unk> several <unk> in front of the open <unk> <unk> press section where i was <unk> faced the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> we arranged that just for you guys
i thought and i 'm sure others did you should n't have <unk>
i 'd <unk> through my only previous <unk> with natural disaster a <unk> N or so <unk> ago near <unk> city mich. so i was <unk> for one reaction to such things the urge to talk about them
perhaps <unk> by the daily diet of radio and tv reporters <unk> <unk> into people 's faces and asking how they feel about one <unk> or another fellow reporters and <unk> who <unk> my press <unk> were eager to <unk>
it felt like i was on a station <unk> and a train went by said one man <unk> my own reaction
a women said she saw the park 's light standards <unk>
a man said he saw the upper <unk> <unk>
i saw neither
<unk> of good sense to the <unk> not <unk> the general <unk> was to believe that the <unk> would be brief and that ball would be played
i was near the top of the stadium and saw a steel <unk> <unk> six feet from where i sat but i stayed put for N or N minutes <unk> a friend
i guess i thought this is the world series and i 'm not <unk> <unk> <unk> out
here in the global <unk> though <unk> do not stay <unk> for long
electrical power was out in <unk> <unk> park but <unk> <unk> and television sets were <unk>
within a few minutes the true extent of the <unk> was becoming clear
its richter scale <unk> was reported as N then N then N
a section of the bay bridge had collapsed as had a part of interstate highway N in oakland
people had died
at N p.m. scheduled game time having passed some fans <unk> let 's play ball
no longer <unk> they <unk> as <unk>
the stadium was ordered <unk> soon <unk> the announcement made over police <unk> cited the power <unk> but it later was <unk> that there also had been damage of the sort reported by my friend
outside i <unk> two young men <unk> <unk> of concrete
pieces of <unk> they said
the crowd remained good <unk> even <unk>
tv reporters interviewed fans in the parking lots while a few feet away others watched the <unk> on their <unk> <unk>
the only <unk> i saw was commercial <unk> selling world series <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> were <unk> by <unk> speculators who saw future profit in the items
the traffic <unk> out of the park was <unk>
it took me a <unk> to move N feet from my parking spot in an <unk> lot to an <unk> and an additional hour to reach an <unk> <unk> a <unk> away
the <unk> <unk> to my airport hotel that had taken N minutes earlier in the day took more than three hours
at my hotel the <unk> power was out some <unk> <unk> had broken loose and there had been water damage but little else
with <unk> <unk> a hotel across the street the <unk> had been hit harder a large sheet of its concrete <unk> and several <unk> <unk> were <unk> away
the <unk> staff had <unk> set out <unk> <unk> in the <unk> prepared a <unk> <unk> and passed around <unk> and <unk>
i fell <unk> on the <unk> floor next to a man wearing a chicago <unk> <unk>
i expected him to say i told you so but he already was <unk>
the <unk> consensus was that the earthquake made the world series seem <unk>
my response was that sports rarely are important only <unk> and the quake merely <unk> that fact
should the rest of the series be played at all
sure
the quake and baseball were n't related unlike the <unk> of <unk> that <unk> the N <unk>
that heavily <unk> event learned nothing from the <unk> experience and seems <unk> to <unk> it
two <unk> <unk>
this has been widely dubbed the <unk> series after the local <unk> line and the bay bridge series
<unk> fly at <unk> for the death of <unk> <unk> the late baseball commissioner and now the bay bridge lies in <unk>
a series that was <unk> up as the <unk> since the <unk> <unk> diego go of N has become <unk> in the least <unk> way
still its edge is lost
it now will be played mostly for the record and should be <unk> up as quickly as possible without off days
and i will never again <unk> about a <unk>
the <unk> in the junk-bond market that began last month with a credit <unk> at campeau corp. has offered commercial banks a golden opportunity to play a greater role in financing <unk> takeovers
but two big new york banks seem to have <unk> those <unk> away for the moment with the <unk> failure of citicorp and chase manhattan corp. to deliver $ N billion in bank financing for a leveraged buy-out of united airlines parent ual corp
for more than a decade banks have been <unk> congress and banking regulators for expanded powers to act like securities firms in playing wall street 's <unk> takeover game from giving mergers advice all the way to selling and trading high-yield junk bonds
those expanded powers reached their <unk> in july when bankers trust new york corp. provided mergers advice an equity investment and bank loans for the $ N billion leveraged buy-out of <unk> airlines parent <unk> inc
one of the major selling points used by los angeles financier <unk> <unk> in getting the takeover approved was that the deal did n't include any junk bonds
that was seen as an advantage in lobbying airline employees and washington regulators for approval of the <unk> takeover
all $ N billion in debt for the deal was <unk> by banks
charles <unk> <unk> of mergers and acquisitions at salomon brothers inc. says it is natural for banks to try to expand beyond their <unk> business of providing senior debt for buy-outs
but the ual collapse he says may tell you it 's not going to work that easily
david <unk> a mergers adviser in la <unk> calif. who aided los angeles investor marvin davis on the bids which put both ual and <unk> in play as takeover candidates this year says that banks have been preparing to play a larger and larger role in acquisition financing
mr. <unk> says that in the past banks would normally have <unk> N N of a total buy-out price with the loans secured by the target company 's assets
another N N of the borrowed funds would come from the sale to investors of junk bonds which offer less security and typically carry higher yields than bank loans
mr. <unk> 's purchase of <unk> mr. <unk> notes was probably the most aggressive to date with bank debt at N N of the purchase price
but mr. <unk> says that citicorp 's failure to deliver on its promise to raise the ual bank debt for a labor-management buy-out group is very <unk> to potential users of a <unk> letter from commercial banks
his client mr. davis used just such a letter from citicorp in pursuing ual citicorp later agreed to work with a competing ual buy-out group
executives of citicorp and chase manhattan declined to comment on either the ual situation or on the changing nature of banks ' role in financing takeovers
in the wake of campeau 's problems prices of junk bonds tumbled <unk> into doubt the ability of corporate <unk> to finance large takeovers with the help of junk bond sales
mark <unk> senior managing director at manufacturers hanover trust co. says the <unk> in junk bonds may yet open new business opportunities to banks in <unk> takeovers
but he <unk> that banks will have to have enough discipline not to make loans that are too risky
in fact manufacturers hanover said in its third-quarter earnings report that fees from <unk> loans to other banks dropped N N to $ N million
we did n't take part in a lot of deals because their credit quality was poor says a bank spokesman
james b. lee head of <unk> and private <unk> at chemical banking corp. said he believes banks can still make a <unk> offer of <unk> shopping for takeover finance
as evidence he <unk> yesterday 's arrangement for the final financing of a $ N billion bid for american medical international inc. in which chemical served as both the lead bank and an equity investor
beyond the current weakness in the junk bond market banks have another advantage over investment banks in financing <unk> takeovers
arthur <unk> jr. a takeover lawyer at <unk> frank harris <unk> & jacobson notes that a political and emotional bias has developed against junk bonds
one hostile <unk> who <unk> avoided using junk bonds was paramount communications inc. in its initial offer to acquire time inc. for $ N billion or $ N a share
a paramount spokesman says that decision was based on the financial not political <unk> of junk bonds
but some observers believe paramount chairman martin davis wanted to avoid the possible <unk> of being perceived as a corporate raider in his controversial bid for time
in the end mr. davis used junk bonds so that he could raise paramount 's bid to $ N a share
some <unk> <unk> said the initial lower bid without junk bonds was a factor in his losing the company
time <unk> paramount by acquiring warner communications inc
the success of the <unk> financing and the failure of the ual deal also seem to <unk> the important new role in takeover financing being played by japanese banks
japanese banks accounted for N N of the <unk> bank debt according to a report by transportation secretary samuel <unk>
but it was <unk> rejection by japanese banks that helped <unk> the <unk> of the attempt to buy ual
citicorp and chase are attempting to put together a new lower bid
<unk> <unk> chief economist of the institute for financial affairs inc. a tokyo research center on finance and economics says the junk bond market became very <unk> and there 's a fear of a coming recession and the possible bankruptcy of lbo companies

<unk> 's complaint claims that the group led by investor malcolm <unk> <unk> violated securities laws by failing to disclose plans to purchase N N of the company 's shares outstanding and that when the required <unk> filing eventually was made it did n't disclose the group 's alleged earlier violation of the so-called <unk> requirements of the law
mr. <unk> could n't immediately be reached to comment
but when <unk> last week publicly questioned the <unk> of the group 's filing procedures the <unk> n.y. investor said we <unk> with every law and he denied any <unk>
the <unk> group said in a securities and exchange commission filing in early october that it may seek a <unk> interest in <unk> or seek <unk> on the company 's board

<unk> steel industries inc. battered by lower volume and higher costs posted a N N drop in third-quarter earnings
the nation 's <unk> <unk> earned $ N million or N cents a share compared with $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier when the industry was <unk> peak demand and strong pricing
sales fell to $ N million from $ N billion
the earnings also mark a significant drop from the second quarter 's $ N million or $ N a share
moreover the earnings were well below analysts ' expectations of about $ N a share
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange <unk> closed yesterday at $ N a share down $ N
the company attributed the earnings drop to lower volume related to seasonal demand and the soft consumer durable market especially in the automotive sector
however the company also lost orders because of <unk> labor talks in the second quarter
third-quarter shipments slipped N N from the year-ago period and N N from this year 's second quarter
profit of steel <unk> for the company 's steel segment slid to $ N a <unk> from $ N a <unk> a year earlier and $ N a <unk> a quarter earlier
analysts noted that the disappointing results do n't reflect lower prices for steel products
charles <unk> an analyst with merrill lynch capital markets said higher prices for <unk> and <unk> products offset lower prices for bar <unk> and structural steel
structural steel which primarily <unk> the construction market was especially hurt by a N N price drop mr. <unk> said
the company said its integrated steel sector was also hurt by higher raw material repair and maintenance and labor costs
the increased labor costs became effective aug. N under terms of the <unk> labor agreement with the united <unk> union
meanwhile the company 's service center segment which saw operating profit drop to $ N million from $ N million a year ago experienced much of the same demand and cost problems as well as start-up costs associated with a <unk> processing facility in chicago and an <unk> computer information system
<unk> chairman frank w. <unk> said the company 's short-term outlook is <unk> by <unk> in the economy and financial markets
however he noted that steel mill <unk> are up from early summer levels and that he expects the company to improve its cost performance in the fourth quarter
in the first nine months profit was $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N billion compared with $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N billion a year earlier

when things are quiet low volatility the structures on which markets stand can be relatively <unk> and still <unk> their <unk> <unk>
however when powerful forces start <unk> the market 's structure the more <unk> it is the better its chance for <unk>
america 's financial markets do not yet have all the required modern features required to make them fully <unk>
investors lack equal access to the markets ' trading <unk> and its information
that structural lack is crucial because investors are the only source of market liquidity
and liquidity is what markets need to <unk> <unk> and aftershocks
in today 's markets specialists on the new york stock exchange and <unk> market makers in the over-the-counter market are the only market participants allowed to play a direct role in the <unk> process
when they halt trading all market liquidity is gone
and when any <unk> of the market cash futures or options <unk> liquidity the price <unk> system the way prices are determined becomes <unk> or is lost entirely for a time
last friday the <unk> as well as two years ago this week the markets became <unk>
when that happened <unk> <unk> of fear much like the shock waves created by an earthquake <unk> through the market and increased the market 's volatility
lack of important needed information can cause fear
fear is the father of panic
panic frequently results in <unk> behavior
and in financial markets <unk> behavior is sometimes translated into <unk>
when market <unk> start it is crucial that as much information about transaction prices and the <unk> <unk> buy and sell orders at various prices be made available to all not just to market makers
because of a lack of information and access many investors including the very ones whose buying power could restore <unk> and <unk> volatility are forced to stand on the <unk> when they are most needed because of their <unk> of important market information
to add <unk> power to america 's markets a modern electronic trading system should be <unk> that <unk> equal access to the trading <unk> and the information that would automatically <unk> such access by investors particularly institutional investors
<unk> to some <unk> the trading activities of specialists and other market makers do not provide liquidity to the market as a whole
what market makers provide is <unk> a very valuable service
liquidity is not a service
it is a market <unk> the ability to absorb selling orders without causing significant price changes in the absence of news
market makers buy what investors wish to sell their business is <unk> these <unk> positions as quickly as possible to other investors and at a profit
as a result while any one customer may purchase <unk> by selling to a market maker which is <unk> for the investor the market as a whole remains in the same circumstances it was before the transaction the <unk> position is still an <unk> position only the <unk> of the seller has changed
in fact it can be argued that increasing capital commitments by market makers a result of some <unk> crash studies also increases market volatility since the more securities are held by market makers at any given time the more selling pressure is <unk> the market
in an open electronic system any investor <unk> to pay for <unk> access to the trading <unk> through a registered <unk> would be able to see the entire <unk> <unk> buy and sell orders at each price entered by dealers and investors <unk> and to enter and <unk> orders
current <unk> would reflect the combined financial judgment of all market participants not just those of <unk> who become extremely <unk> during times of crisis
investors and professionals <unk> would compete on the level playing field congress sought and called a national market system not yet achieved almost N years ago when it passed the securities reform act of N
last friday 's market gyrations did not result in severe aftershocks
were we <unk> or just lucky
i 'm not certain
but i am sure we need to <unk> our earthquake protection by making certain that our market structures let investors add their <unk> <unk> power to our nation 's markets
mr. <unk> is chairman of his own consulting company in <unk> <unk>
now you see it now you do n't
the recession that is
the economy 's <unk> steps leave investors <unk> whether things are slowing down or <unk> up
so often are government statistics revised that they seem to <unk> a <unk> weather <unk>
for the past seven years investors have had the wind at their <unk> in the form of a generally growing economy
some may have <unk> and some younger ones may never have experienced what it 's like to invest during a recession
different <unk> are called for as losing money becomes easier and making money becomes tougher
for those investors who believe or fear that N will be a recession year many economists and money managers agree on steps that can be taken to lower the risks in a portfolio
in a <unk> <unk> <unk> investors who expect a slowdown to hold fewer stocks than usual and to favor shares of big companies in defensive industries
a heavy <unk> of cash is <unk> along with a <unk> <unk> to bonds <unk> government bonds
it 's <unk> to think these defensive steps can be delayed until a recession is clearly at hand
but that may not be possible because <unk> often take investors by surprise
they always seem to come a bit later than you expect
when they do hit they hit fast says david a. <unk> chief financial economist at the data resources division of <unk> inc
though he himself does n't expect a recession soon mr. <unk> <unk> people who do that the best thing to be in is long that is <unk> to 30-year treasury bonds
the reason is simple mr. <unk> says interest rates almost always decline during recession
as <unk> as a <unk> <unk> falling interest rates force up the price of previously issued bonds
they are worth more because they pay higher interest than newly issued bonds do
that effect holds true for both short-term and long-term bonds
but short-term bonds ca n't rise too much because everyone knows they will be <unk> at a <unk> price fairly soon
long-term bonds with many years left before maturity <unk> more widely in price
but not just any bonds will do
corporate bonds are usually not a good bet in a recession mr. <unk> says
as times get tougher investors <unk> about whether companies will have enough money to pay their debts
this <unk> the price of corporate bonds
also he notes most corporate bonds are <unk>
that means that a corporation after a specified amount of time has passed can buy back its bonds by paying investors the face value plus in some cases a <unk>
when interest rates have dropped it makes sense for corporations to do just that they then save on interest costs
but the investors are left <unk> with money to <unk> at a time when interest rates are <unk>
if corporate bonds are bad in <unk> junk bonds are likely to be the worst of all
it 's an <unk> <unk> to get out of junk bonds when a recession is in the <unk> says <unk> <unk> professor of finance at <unk> university
such bonds are very sensitive to the <unk> and this could be a disaster
municipal bonds are generally a bit safer than corporate bonds in a recession but not as safe as bonds issued by the federal government
during an economic slump local tax revenues often go down raising the risks associated with at least some municipals
and like <unk> many municipal bonds are <unk>
but a few experts going against the consensus do n't think bonds would help investors even if a recession is in the <unk>
one of these is jeffrey l. beach director of research for <unk> <unk> & co. a brokerage house in houston who thinks that we 're either in a recession or about to go into one
what 's more he thinks this could be a <unk> recession than usual once the downturn comes it 's going to be very hard to reverse
investors he <unk> should be cautious holding fewer stocks than usual and also <unk> bonds
because he sees a N N to N N base rate of inflation in the economy he <unk> that interest rates will fall much any time soon
instead mr. beach says investors probably should be carrying a very high level of cash by which he means such so-called cash <unk> as money-market funds and treasury bills
<unk> <unk> president of <unk> financial inc. in <unk> <unk> also <unk> that investors go heavily for cash
he is n't sure a recession is coming but says the other likely alternative <unk> inflation is just as bad
this late in an expansion the economy <unk> to <unk> off either into <unk> inflation or into a recession mr. <unk> says
the federal reserve board 's plan for a soft landing he says requires the fed to <unk> an <unk> <unk>
a soft landing is n't something that can be achieved once and for all mr. <unk> adds
it has to be engineered over and over again month after month
he believes that the task facing fed chairman alan <unk> is so difficult that it <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> and a <unk> saw
and in a sense that 's the kind of task individuals face in deciding what to do about stocks the <unk> of most serious investors ' portfolios
it comes down to a question of whether to try to time the market
for people who can ride out market waves through good times and bad stocks have been <unk> long-term investments
most studies show that <unk> investors <unk> have earned an annual return from stocks of N N to N N including both dividends and price appreciation
that 's well above what bonds or bank certificates have paid
moreover because no one knows for sure just when a recession is coming some analysts think investors should n't even worry too much about timing
trying to time the economy is a <unk> says david katz chief investment officer of value <unk> management inc. in new york
mr. katz notes that some economists have been predicting a recession for at least two years
investors who <unk> and <unk> up on stocks have just hurt themselves he says
mr. katz adds that people who jump in and out of the stock market need to be right about N N of the time to beat a <unk> strategy
<unk> trading runs up high commission costs
and the <unk> might miss the sudden <unk> that account for much of the stock market 's gains over time
still few investors are able to sit tight when they are convinced a recession is coming
after all in all five <unk> since N stocks declined
according to <unk> davis president of <unk> davis research inc. in <unk> fla. the average drop in the dow jones industrial average was about N N and the <unk> began an average of six months before a recession officially started
by the time a recession is official two consecutive quarters of declining gross national product much of the damage to stocks has already been done and in the typical case the recession is already half over
about six months before a recession ends stocks typically begin to rise again as investors anticipate a recovery
the average recession <unk> about a year
unfortunately though <unk> vary enough in <unk> so that the average ca n't <unk> be used to guide investors in timing stock sales or purchases
but whatever their advice about timing none of these experts <unk> <unk> stocks entirely during a recession
for the portion of an investor 's portfolio that <unk> in stocks professionals have a number of suggestions
mr. katz <unk> issues with low <unk> <unk> that is low prices in <unk> to the company 's earnings per share
low <unk> stocks he says <unk> <unk> others during a recession or bear market
in good times he says they <unk> a bit but overall they provide <unk> performance
<unk> <unk> <unk> investors to <unk> stocks in small companies
<unk> shares typically fall more than <unk> stocks in a recession he says
and in any case he <unk> stocks of small companies are almost as <unk> as they were sept. N N just before the crash
for example mr. <unk> says stocks of small companies are selling for about N times cash flow
cash flow <unk> earnings plus <unk> is one common <unk> of a company 's financial health
that ratio is <unk> close to the ratio of N that <unk> before the N stock-market crash mr. <unk> says
and it 's way above the ratio N times cash flow that bigger companies are selling for
another major <unk> in making a portfolio <unk> is <unk> stocks in defensive industries
food tobacco drugs and utilities are the classic <unk>
recession or not people still eat smoke and take <unk> when they 're <unk>

yesterday prudential-bache securities inc. said it <unk> a $ N million senior subordinated <unk> offering by york international corp
and donaldson lufkin & jenrette securities corp. <unk> to restructure and improve the potential returns on a $ N million <unk> offering by chicago & north western acquisition corp. that was still being negotiated late last night
the issue by chicago & north western is one of the so-called good junk-bond offerings on the <unk> <unk>
some analysts said the restructuring of the railroad concern 's issue shows how tough it is for underwriters to sell even the junk bonds of a company considered to be a relatively good credit risk
since last week 's junk-bond market <unk> many new issues of high-yield high-risk corporate bonds have either been <unk> back delayed or dropped

prudential-bache said the york issue was delayed because of market conditions
everything is going through <unk> right now and chicago & north western is no <unk> said <unk> <unk> vice president high-yield research at citicorp
portfolio managers say <unk> like equity <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> may increasingly be required to sell junk-bond deals
<unk> <unk> managing director of high-yield investments at chancellor capital management said the chicago & north western offering was <unk> in part because several large insurance buyers right now are <unk> equity as part of the package
if you 're going to take the risk in this market you want something extra
mr. <unk> <unk> the offering
but several <unk> managers nervous about the <unk> quality of their junk-bond portfolios and <unk> about buying new issues said they 're <unk> away from any junk security that is n't considered first rate for its class
while they consider the chicago & north western issue to be good they do n't view it as the best
to <unk> buyers to the chicago & north western bonds portfolio managers said donaldson lufkin <unk> the transaction by offering the bonds with a <unk> interest rate and a N N equity <unk>
the bonds are expected to have a N N N coupon rate
the equity arrangement apparently would allow <unk> to buy a total of N N of the stock of <unk> corp. chicago & north western 's parent company
donaldson lufkin declined to comment on the restructuring
according to some analysts familiar with the negotiations the N N of equity would come directly from donaldson lufkin and a fund <unk> with the investment bank <unk> group which would reduce their <unk> equity holdings by N N each
that would leave the <unk> fund with a N N stake and donaldson lufkin with N N
despite the problems with new issues high-yield bonds showed gains in the secondary or <unk> market
junk bonds ended about <unk> point higher with so-called <unk> issues from rjr capital holdings corp. and <unk> gas service limited partnership rising one point

the move was interpreted by some economists as a sign that the fed does n't want the federal funds rate to move any lower than the N N N at which it has been <unk> around during the past week
the closely watched funds rate is what banks charge each other on overnight loans
it is considered an early signal of fed credit policy changes
the fact that they did <unk> matched sales means they are not in a mood to ease aggressively
they are telling us that N N N is as low as they want to see the fed funds rate said robert <unk> at <unk> bank plc

<unk> that their money would more likely go toward a <unk> of night train express most people have little trouble saying no to <unk> like this
but healthy <unk> <unk> when they are <unk> by an organized charity to help fight cancer <unk> child <unk> or what have you
most see little reason to doubt that their cash will go toward these <unk> goals
but will it
in a <unk> number of cases no
in fact the <unk> sometimes might be better off giving the money to the <unk> at least he has no <unk> and he might even be telling the truth
last year more than $ N billion was <unk> to the nation 's N charities
while the vast bulk of it was indeed spent by <unk> organizations on the good works it was raised for it 's <unk> true that a <unk> <unk> was <unk> in expenses claimed by other operators including <unk> expenses
in many cases the costs claimed were so high that only a <unk> of cash was left for the <unk> beneficiaries
it 's impossible to say exactly how much of the total charity <unk> is <unk> by <unk> <unk> costs <unk> operators and <unk> fraud
but the problem clearly is widespread and <unk>
state law <unk> can barely keep up with charity scams and reports from <unk> groups such as the council of better business <unk> are not encouraging
the <unk> advisory service of the <unk> reviews hundreds of new charities every year <unk> them against minimum standards for <unk> for <unk> and <unk> in solicitation and for percentage of funds actually going to work for which the charity was <unk> established
the service figures at least half of the money taken in should be spent on program
roughly a third of the charities <unk> <unk> the test
which it should be added does n't prevent the charities from <unk> in a lot of money anyway
without a <unk> and a <unk> it 's often hard to sort out <unk> causes from <unk> if all you 've got to go on is the solicitation itself
on this basis there 's no way the average person can know a good charity from a bad one says david <unk> an assistant attorney general in connecticut
a lot of <unk> just get taken
including those he contends who put about $ N million into the <unk> for the connecticut association of concerned veterans and the vietnam veterans service center
the state has sued these charities in state court <unk> that much of the money was <unk> <unk> N N says mr. <unk> went to fund <unk> and most of the rest to the people who ran the charities and to their <unk> for fur <unk> <unk> to florida <unk> restaurant <unk>
the telephone number for the charity in <unk> conn. has been <unk> and the former officials could n't be located
running a charity does cost money but <unk> organizations manage to get the <unk> 's share of donations out to where they are really needed
the <unk> foundation the american cancer society and the united way of america all say that they spend roughly N N of their income on programs not <unk>
with some other charities however it s the other way around
the <unk> national children 's cancer society for example took in $ N million last year to finance <unk> <unk> for children
by the time it paid its expenses it only had $ N left not enough to <unk> even one child
the state of illinois is <unk> the charity for fraud in chicago along with <unk> marketing inc. its <unk> fund <unk>
both deny <unk>
the charity admits spending a lot on fund raising but says that was necessary to establish a <unk> base it can <unk> at much lower cost in years to come
michael <unk> president of <unk> says his concern has only benefited from the publicity surrounding the case noting that three other charities have signed on as clients because they were <unk> with the amount he raised for national children 's
meanwhile a state court judge has allowed the charity to go on <unk> funds
<unk> ca n't put charities out of business simply because they spend the <unk> 's share of their income on fund raising
state laws previously used as a <unk> minimum <unk> of income usually half that had to be spent on the program rather than <unk> but these have been <unk> by the u.s. supreme court
it has ruled that such laws might work to <unk> fund raising which would amount to <unk> the charities ' <unk> right to freedom of <unk>
this puts upon <unk> the burden of <unk> <unk> fraud or <unk> and such actions have been brought against hundreds of charities recently
the attorney general 's office in connecticut alone has put seven of them out of business over the past couple of years and the enforcement drive is continuing there and elsewhere
in making cases the authorities frequently <unk> in on alleged <unk> made by the charities ' fund <unk>
illinois for instance currently has under investigation N of the N companies <unk> up funds for charities <unk> there
<unk> pay special attention to operators using <unk> <unk> as an additional <unk> to give
attorneys general in several states including illinois are already <unk> <unk> & <unk> co. an <unk> <unk> <unk> that they say has used <unk> <unk> ads to <unk> donations for the american heart <unk> foundation and the cancer fund of america
according to the illinois attorney general 's suit <unk> & <unk> sent <unk> indicating that <unk> were guaranteed cash <unk> and could win up to an additional $ N on top of them if they contributed as little as $ N
but the total value of the <unk> was only $ N and most winners will receive just N cents according to the attorney general 's office
the suit is still pending in illinois state court
<unk> & <unk> has denied the allegations in court officials decline to comment further
while they can target some of the most obvious <unk> <unk> <unk> that they are only <unk> the <unk>
there are so many <unk> <unk> used by so many <unk> operators they say that it is probably impossible to stop them all
one <unk> the public education <unk>
the solicitation material indicates that donations will go toward a campaign <unk> and <unk> the public about some health or other issue
what it does n't say is that the entire campaign may be the <unk> letter itself
all too often this will merely be a statement on the solicitation such as do n't smoke or wear <unk> <unk> says william webster attorney general of missouri
by putting these <unk> statements on the <unk> hundreds of thousands of dollars are claimed to have been spent on education to consumers when in fact this represents the costs of sending the <unk>
mr. webster <unk> a <unk> <unk> from the united cancer council that offers a chance to win $ N in gold <unk> to those giving as little as $ N to cancer education
a few <unk> <unk> about cancer appear but that 's only two <unk> in all four pages
i think some people may believe they 're helping fund a massive tv and <unk> campaign but we could n't find that the charity does anything except write these letters he says
officials at the washington <unk> charity did n't return repeated phone calls
many <unk> charities ride the <unk> of the biggest <unk> and most <unk> ones by <unk> names similar to <unk>
the established charities are <unk> by this but say they can do little about it
we ca n't police the many organizations that have <unk> up in the last few years using part of our name
most of them do n't last for long but in the <unk> all we can do is tell people they are n't connected with us says a spokeswoman for the american heart association
and sometimes a <unk> charity with a household name gets used and does n't even know it
a couple in <unk> <unk> raised $ N earlier this year using the name and <unk> of <unk> against <unk> driving without permission from the group
<unk> did n't learn of the fund raising until the couple sent it a check for $ N along with a letter saying that was the charity 's share
the illinois attorney general won a court order to prevent the couple from raising further funds without <unk> 's permission

british airways plc a crucial <unk> in the proposed buy-out of ual corp. <unk> its hands of the current efforts to revive a bid for the parent of united airlines
specifically the british carrier said it currently has no plans to participate in any new offer for ual
in addition british air officially withdrew its support for the previous $ 300-a-share bid in a <unk> statement that said the original deal is closed
company officials said later that british airways believes its involvement in the ual buy-out ended last friday when the buy-out group which also includes ual 's management and pilot union failed to obtain financing for the $ N billion transaction
the carrier stopped short of saying it would n't at some point <unk> participating in any new bid for ual
however company officials said they plan to take no <unk> to <unk> the transaction and are n't aware of any <unk> bid in the making
<unk> the statements raised questions about whether a new bid for ual will ever get off the ground
the transaction has had a series of <unk> since the financing problems became known last friday with no signs or statements from the buy-out group to indicate that any progress has taken place
however in response to the british air decision united 's pilot union <unk> to continue efforts to revive the buy-out
pilot union chairman <unk> c. <unk> said advisers to ual management and the union will begin meeting in new york today and will work through the weekend to <unk> a new proposal to present to ual 's board at the <unk> time possible
pilot union advisers appeared confident that a new bid could go forward even without british air 's participation
ual declined to comment on british air 's statement
ual chairman stephen m. wolf who is leading the management end of the buy-out has n't provided investors with any assurances about the prospect of a new deal
in another setback yesterday united 's <unk> union asked the treasury department to <unk> whether certain aspects of the original buy-out proposal violated tax laws
in an effort to <unk> the buy-out the union has already called for investigations by the securities and exchange commission transportation department and labor department
but there was one bright spot yesterday
the united <unk> union agreed to negotiations that could lead to the flight <unk> <unk> concessions to a <unk> bid in exchange for an ownership stake
the pilot union the only one to support the buy-out thus far said the flight <unk> ' decision <unk> our belief that an <unk> owned airline is practical and <unk>
still without the <unk> of british airways ' financial backing it will be tougher for the buy-out group to <unk> <unk> banks to make loan commitments for a revised bid especially since british air 's original investment represented N N of the cash equity contribution for the bid
under the previous plan british air would have received a N N stake in ual in exchange for a $ N million equity investment with a N N stake going to ual employees and N N to ual management
british air officials said the airline 's chairman <unk> king was concerned about news reports indicating that british air might be willing to participate in a bid that included a lower purchase price and better investment terms for the british carrier
the previous reports were based on <unk> by british air 's chief financial officer <unk> stevens who said any revised bid would have to include a lower purchase price to reflect the sharp drop in ual 's stock in the past week
ual stock dropped $ N yesterday to $ N on volume of N shares in composite trading on the new york stock exchange
ual declined to comment on british air 's statement
in an interview wednesday with dow jones professional investor report mr. stevens said we 're in no way committed to a deal going through at all
we 're not <unk> into anything
we do n't want to be party to a second rejection
indeed british air seemed to be <unk> itself from the troubled transaction early in an effort to avoid any further <unk>
the original transaction fell through on the same day british air shareholders approved the plan at a special meeting after the british succeeded in <unk> the financing for its equity contribution
the carrier also seemed eager to place blame on its american <unk>
the buy-out <unk> <unk> to exist because our american partners were not <unk> of <unk> the financing a british air spokesman said
british airways may have begun to have second <unk> about the transaction after the transportation department forced <unk> 's airlines ' new owners to restructure the equity contribution of <unk> royal dutch airlines in that carrier
most of the department 's statements since the <unk> transaction indicated it planned to <unk> foreign ownership stakes in u.s. carriers
even before british air 's announcement pilot union leaders had been meeting in chicago yesterday to consider their options
the leaders expressed support for trying to revive the bid following a <unk> wednesday by the union 's advisers <unk> <unk> & co. and paul <unk> <unk> <unk> & <unk>
they also <unk> <unk> mr. <unk> the union chairman who has led the pilots ' N <unk> fight to take control of the airline
ual 's advisers have indicated previously that it may take a while to come forward with a revised plan since they want to have firm bank commitments before <unk> a new bid
they have maintained that banks remain interested in financing the transaction
the buy-out fell through after citicorp and chase manhattan corp. the lead banks in the transaction failed to obtain $ N billion in financing needed for the plan

a core group of six or so democratic senators has been working behind the <unk> to develop a proposal to reduce the tax on the gain from the sale of assets
the plan was complete except for <unk> <unk> and there was talk that it would be unveiled as early as yesterday
but senate majority leader george mitchell d. <unk> a <unk> <unk> of the capital-gains tax cut called the group to meet with him wednesday night and again yesterday
sen. mitchell urged them to <unk>
<unk> leaders of the dissident democrats <unk> and said they would n't offer their own proposal as they had planned
the decision is a setback for president bush who needs the support of democrats to pass the tax cut through the <unk> senate
having a proposal <unk> by democrats would have given the president an advantage
having only a republican measure makes the task harder
still sen. bob <unk> r. <unk> the lead <unk> of the republican capital-gains amendment predicted that the tax cut would be enacted this year
he said a clear majority of senators back the tax reduction and that ultimately there would be enough senators to <unk> any <unk> <unk> the democratic leadership might <unk>
but sen. mitchell <unk> by his victory among fellow democrats strongly <unk>
mr. mitchell has been predicting that the president 's initiative would fail this year
yesterday in an interview he added that the democrats ' decision increases the <unk> that a capital-gains tax cut will not pass this year
mr. mitchell 's first victory came last week when the senate passed a deficit-reduction bill that did n't contain a capital-gains provision
that vote made it unlikely that a capital-gains tax cut would be included in the final bill now being <unk> by house and senate <unk>
the house version of the bill does include the tax cut
now republican leaders are <unk> on <unk> a capital-gains amendment to some other bill perhaps a measure raising the federal borrowing limit or a second tax bill that would follow on the <unk> of the deficit-reduction legislation
to help lay the <unk> for that fight president bush plans early next week to meet at the white house with some N democratic senators who favor cutting the capital-gains tax or are <unk> on the issue
the president apparently will have only one bill to push sen. <unk> 's and at least some of the dissident democrats plan to support it
i may want to offer additional <unk> to improve it when the bill comes to the floor said sen. david <unk> d. <unk> a leader of those democrats
the <unk> plan as expected would allow individuals to exclude from income N N of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year
the <unk> would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held until it reached a maximum of N N after seven years
the <unk> would apply to assets sold after oct. N
as an alternative taxpayers could <unk> to reduce their gains by an inflation index
for corporations the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to N N from the current top rate of N N
that rate would <unk> decline to as little as N N for corporate assets held for N years
the <unk> plan also would include a proposal designed by sen. william <unk> r. <unk> that would create new tax benefits for individual retirement accounts
the <unk> plan would create a new <unk> <unk> from which money could be <unk> <unk> not only for retirement but also for the purchase of a first home education expenses and medical expenses
current <unk> could be <unk> over into the new <unk> but would be subject to tax though no <unk>
westmoreland coal co. <unk> benefits of a sustained effort to cut costs and boost productivity reported sharply improved third-quarter results
the producer and <unk> of <unk> coal said net income for the quarter was $ N million or N cents a share on revenue of $ N million
for the year-earlier period the company reported a loss of $ N or six cents a share
in the latest nine months the company earned $ N million or $ N a share
last year 's net loss of $ N included a benefit of $ N from an accounting change
revenue for the nine months rose to $ N million from $ N million
in an interview <unk> <unk> president and chief executive cited several reasons for the improvement higher employee productivity and good natural conditions in the mines as well as lower costs for materials administrative <unk> and debt interest
in the latest nine months mr. <unk> said total coal sales rose to about N million tons from about N million tons a year earlier
in addition long-term debt has been <unk> to about $ N million from $ N million since jan. N
he predicted the debt ratio will improve further in coming quarters
westmoreland 's strategy is to retain and expand its core business of mining and selling <unk> coal in the <unk> region
the operating <unk> includes coal <unk> on the ohio river and in newport news <unk>
westmoreland exports about a fourth of its coal <unk> including a significant amount of <unk> coal produced by others that is used by <unk> overseas
for the past couple of years westmoreland has <unk> an aggressive <unk> of all aspects of its business
<unk> operations and assets have been sold
the size of the company 's board has been reduced to eight directors from N
about N <unk> management jobs and hundreds of <unk> wage positions have been eliminated
even <unk> have been reduced
for example the chief executive himself now pays N N of the cost of his health benefits the company used to pay N N
i think the ship is now <unk> the <unk> are <unk> and we are on course mr. <unk> said of the restructuring program
much of what we set out to do is completed
but he <unk> that westmoreland 's third quarter is typically better than the fourth so investors should n't just <unk> the third quarter by four and assume the same rate of improvement can be sustained
one difference he said is that the fourth quarter has significantly fewer <unk> because of <unk> and the <unk> season
i do n't want to give the <unk> that everybody can <unk> now he said
we have to keep working at <unk> our core business to stay efficient
it 's a process that never really ends
nevertheless mr. <unk> predicted that N would be <unk> profitable for westmoreland and that N would bring more of the same
for all of N the company reported an after-tax operating loss of $ N on revenue of $ N million
an accounting adjustment made net income $ N million or N cents a share
in a move that <unk> the company 's basic strategy its westmoreland energy inc. unit is developing four <unk> <unk> plants with a partner in virginia
some of the coal the plants buy will come from westmoreland mines
mr. <unk> predicted that the unit 's contribution to company results in the 1990s will be <unk>
he said westmoreland is looking at investment stakes in other <unk> plants east of the <unk> river
westmoreland expects energy demand to grow annually in the N N range in the early 1990s
we see coal 's piece of the action growing mr. <unk> said
coal prices while not <unk> will grow <unk> in real terms we think
chase manhattan corp. after trying <unk> to sell its interest in its lower manhattan operations building has <unk> its option to purchase the <unk> office tower
chase had purchased an option to buy the building at one new york <unk> for an <unk> sum from the late <unk> <unk> as part of its original lease in N
the current transaction cost the bank approximately $ N million
of that amount $ N million was payment for the land <unk> the building and the rest was for the building itself
the building houses about N chase workers most of whom will be moved to downtown <unk> after the bank 's new back office center is completed in N
the move is part of chase 's strategy to <unk> its back offices under one <unk>
the headquarters is located a few <unk> away at N chase manhattan <unk>
as part of its decision to leave the building chase tried to sell its interest along with the <unk> estate 's interest shortly after the october N stock market crash
chase senior vice president george <unk> said the bank decided to exercise its option after bids fell short of expectations
he said chase and the <unk> estate were looking to sell the entire building for $ N million to $ N million but did n't get an offer for more than $ N million
as the building 's new owner chase will have its work cut out for it
chase is <unk> N million square feet of space and salomon brothers inc. whose headquarters is in the building also plans to move shortly
in addition another major building <unk> <unk> <unk> inc. 's <unk> <unk> securities likely will <unk> the <unk> as part of its <unk>
new york real estate brokerage edward s. <unk> co. will have the difficult task of finding new <unk>
even with its striking views of the new york <unk> the building is considered <unk> by modern office standards
and chase will have to spend approximately $ N million to remove asbestos from the <unk>
wall street <unk> hands with george <unk>
the author of the <unk> novel N <unk> a language called <unk> that made it impossible to fully develop a <unk> thought that is anything negative about the policies and practices of the state
wall street has n't gotten that far yet but it has made a promising start
its language call it <unk> is increasingly <unk> <unk> and designed to make financial products and <unk> appear better safer or cheaper than they really are
when something <unk> <unk> <unk> a few <unk> are <unk> to simply make it <unk> much as a fresh <unk> may be covered by a <unk> of <unk>
for example we 'll bet you thought that the stock market <unk> two years ago
wrong
according to some of the grand <unk> of the market it never happened
in their <unk> the <unk> collapse in the dow jones industrial average on oct. N N was just a big <unk>
<unk> out a <unk> <unk> term new york stock exchange chairman john <unk> recently declared that history would record the event as only a major technical <unk>
another <unk> saying however this one in <unk> english holds that if something <unk> like a <unk> and <unk> like a <unk> it is a <unk>
on oct. N N a date <unk> <unk> insist on <unk> with the <unk> <unk> the <unk> industrials fell N N
in the technical <unk> of two years ago they lost a <unk> N N
customers hear a lot of this stuff from people who try to sell them stock
these people used to be called brokers but apparently this word either is not <unk> enough or carries too many negative <unk> from the <unk> technical <unk> when <unk> customers could n't raise brokers on the phone
either way the word broker is clearly out of favor
of the major new york-based securities firms only morgan stanley & co. still calls its salespeople brokers
at merrill lynch & co. and shearson lehman hutton inc. they are financial consultants
at drexel burnham lambert inc. prudential <unk> securities and dean witter reynolds inc. they are account executives
at painewebber inc. they are investment executives
such <unk> are designed to <unk> a sense of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> in selling today 's <unk> financial products
it is a <unk> and <unk> that some brokers themselves <unk> by all the new things being <unk> up for them to <unk> do n't feel
it s almost product de <unk> <unk> one account executive at dean witter
the <unk> brokers never let the <unk> cross their <unk> instead <unk> such terms as safe insured and guaranteed even though these terms may be <unk> limited in their <unk> to a particular new financial product
the names of some of these products do n't suggest the risk involved in buying them either
a case in point <unk> bond funds
what could <unk> more safety than investing in government bonds
what could be better than getting a <unk> more income from them the plus than other people
indeed conservative investors many of them elderly have <unk> more than $ N billion into such funds which promise <unk> yields than <unk> treasury bonds only to learn later that these funds use part of their money to <unk> in high-risk bond options a <unk> 's game
when a certain class of investment <unk> so poorly that its reputation is <unk> look for wall street to give it a new <unk>
this seems to be happening now to limited partnerships many of which either have gone into the <unk> in recent years or have otherwise been <unk> <unk>
they are still being sold but more and more often as direct investments with all the same risks they had under the old <unk>
in such cases the game has n't changed only the name
in others a familiar old name still <unk> but the underlying game has changed
for example no load mutual funds remain a favorite with investors because they do n't carry a <unk> sales commission
getting out of them however may be a different story now
traditional <unk> made their money by charging an annual management <unk> usually a modest one they imposed no other fees and many still do n't
in recent years though a <unk> of others flying the <unk> flag have been <unk> hefty charges all the way up to N N when an investor sells his shares
should n't they <unk> be called <unk> funds
the <unk> industry is <unk> the question but do n't expect a new name while the old one is working so well
and do n't expect anyone to change the term blue chip either even though some of the companies that still <unk> the title may be <unk> investments than they were
american telephone & telegraph co. for one is still a favorite of <unk> <unk> and trust departments but <unk> of its regional telephone units and <unk> to competition on every side it is a far different investment prospect than it was before <unk>
also blue chips in general have suffered much more short-term price volatility in recent years
<unk> <unk> a money manager in san <unk> calif. <unk> that on the <unk> of program trading in which computers used by big institutional investors are <unk> to buy and sell big <unk> when certain market conditions <unk>
blue chips he says are now being <unk> to as <unk> chips
finally even the <unk> strategy called value investing no longer means what it once did
before the takeover <unk> of the <unk> it <unk> to <unk> out through analysis <unk> stocks especially those with <unk> management sound fundamentals and <unk> prospects
now says mr. <unk> value investing often means looking for <unk> companies with <unk> management that are in real trouble
to institutional investors or brokers he adds a company with value is a company at risk of being <unk> up
ms. <unk> covers personal finance from the wall street journal 's los angeles bureau
i was <unk> to read your recent news stories on the banking industry 's reserve <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> making new loans to less-developed countries
if the whole story were told it would read something like this
during the 1970s the commercial banks <unk> the country loan business away from the bond markets where the discipline of a <unk> and use of proceeds <unk> allowed lenders to audit expenditures of old loans before new loans were made
the <unk> for that <unk> lending was high reported earnings and management bonuses the price a sea of bad loans
for the past several years the banks <unk> a private navy to <unk> their interests have been <unk> the u.s. treasury to <unk> their bad <unk> credits
the treasury <unk> has refused but has concluded that <unk> credit support through various <unk> agencies should be made available for a price either debt reduction or <unk> reduction or new loans the brady plan
the banks will <unk> not to make further loans but in truth <unk> the capital to write off their <unk> or to build a navy they have no alternative but to go along

<unk> <unk> earlier this year bought $ N million of preferred stock in <unk> that is convertible into an N N stake and <unk> said at the time that mr. <unk> would be added to the board
separately <unk> said its third-quarter earnings rose N N to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or N cents a share in the year-earlier period per-share earnings remained flat despite an increase in net income in part because the company paid a $ N million dividend on the new preferred stock in the period
sales rose N N to $ N million from $ N million with sales of the company 's <unk> operations well above the year <unk>
for the nine months <unk> 's net income declined N N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share in the N period
sales rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange the company closed yesterday at $ N a share up N cents
when walter <unk> the president of sony corp. 's cbs records last month told producer peter guber that sony was about to make a $ N billion bid for columbia pictures and needed someone to run the studio mr. guber jumped at the chance
within two days he was on his way to new york and tokyo to meet with top <unk> at sony
and before the week was out sony had offered mr. guber and his partner <unk> peters the most <unk> employment contracts in the history of the movie business
not only that sony also agreed to give them a stake in columbia 's future profits and buy their company guber peters entertainment co. for $ N million almost N N more than the market value of the company
there was just one <unk> point the two had a prior commitment
just seven months earlier they had signed a five-year exclusive contract to make movies for warner <unk> for which they had just produced the <unk> hit <unk>
but mr. guber figured that warner communications inc. chairman steven ross would <unk> and let the producers go <unk> the sony offer was the <unk> of a life 's work
he figured wrong
last week following <unk> settlement talks warner now <unk> with time inc. filed a $ N billion <unk> of contract suit in los angeles <unk> court against both sony and guber peters
sony <unk> <unk> charging warner with trying to <unk> its acquisitions and hurt its efforts to enter the u.s. movie business
the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> are flying <unk> and fast on both sides as one sony executive puts it it 's world war iii
that two successful producers who are n't all that well known outside hollywood could <unk> such a <unk> of corporate <unk> suggests how <unk> the <unk> for proven <unk> is in the movie business
and they are a very <unk> team in any case
mr. guber was raised in boston and <unk> in new york
he is a lawyer with a string of academic <unk>
mr. peters is a <unk> <unk> who came to <unk> as <unk> <unk> 's <unk>
yet they are far and away the most <unk> producers in hollywood
and despite their share of <unk> they make movies that make money
that is a <unk> sony badly needs and warner is <unk> to lose
although columbia had a good summer with <unk> ii and when harry met <unk> rivals such as warner paramount pictures <unk> disney co. and universal <unk> have been <unk> columbia at the box office
after five years of management turmoil with four different studio heads columbia <unk> needs a stable <unk> team to restore its credibility and get it back in the business of making hits
mr. guber and mr. peters are n't <unk> <unk> in hollywood but they are well connected
their stock in trade as executive producers is <unk> out hot properties <unk> them up and then getting big <unk> to <unk> and distribute them
sometimes mr. guber and mr. peters do little more than <unk> the first <unk> of a <unk> for a <unk> or buy rights to a best seller such as the color <unk>
it falls to others to do the writing <unk> and producing
with mgm\/ua 's <unk> for instance messrs. guber and peters had virtually nothing to do with <unk> production but their names still appear in big letters on the credits and they are <unk> associated with its success
sometimes as with <unk> the <unk> really do make the film
in that case guber peters acquired the rights in N <unk> the movie through a dozen <unk> and were on the set in london for N months <unk> over the most <unk> changes in <unk> and production
they 're the best production <unk> around says <unk> de <unk> <unk> to guber peters for hiring him to direct the warner movie of tom <unk> 's novel <unk> of the <unk>
on that film which is to start <unk> in a few months they 've been very much involved hiring <unk> and discussing the development of the <unk>
and when you 're making a movie this big you need all the help you can get mr. de <unk> adds
i wish they were around N hours a day
and some movies seem to have been hurt by their <unk>
warner executives blame mr. guber 's and mr. peters 's lack of involvement in <unk> ii for <unk> and production problems and the film 's <unk> dismal failure
we 've had a few <unk> admits mr. peters
but by and large this company has only been profitable
he says his company 's <unk> at <unk> and marketing is why we 'll be good at columbia
we <unk> ran our own studio
longtime hollywood associates <unk> mr. guber as the <unk> <unk> of the two a man with a <unk> for <unk> and marketing
peter is a major piece of hollywood <unk> who has really earned his success says robert <unk> an agent at creative artists agency
mark johnson the producer of <unk> <unk> in he has a great ability to hire <unk> people and <unk> authority
it 's no accident that they 've been able to develop such successful material
mr. peters on the other hand has fewer fans in hollywood and his <unk> like to <unk> him as something of a <unk> <unk>
he gets better reviews as a creative <unk> an <unk> an idea man
he also had to fight harder for credibility than his partner did
<unk> <unk> made him famous
he cut her <unk>
he lived with her
he came to produce her records and her movies a star is born and the main event
<unk> married but now single mr. peters got plenty of <unk> last summer for an <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> during the making of <unk>
mr. guber by contrast has been married to one woman for more than N years
but for all their <unk> and <unk> differences they make the perfect good <unk> bad <unk> team hollywood associates say
peter is the bright <unk> guy when you 're doing a deal says one agent
if there 's a problem peter <unk> and all of a sudden <unk> shows up
mr. guber and mr. peters <unk> many people in hollywood the wrong way
producers don <unk> and jerry <unk> who <unk> <unk> through several <unk> and ultimately produced the movie <unk> when messrs. guber and peters take credit for the film
says mr. <unk> the <unk> was <unk>
we <unk> it
we are the producers of that movie
they got a small piece of the net profits and a screen credit as executive producers
when roger <unk> an executive who worked for guber peters in the early 1980s left to take a job as head of production at the united artists studio they made him <unk> all credits and financial interest in the <unk> he had helped develop including <unk> and <unk>
mr. peters acknowledges that and says it 's not unlike the situation he and mr. guber are in with warner
i was <unk> with roger i <unk> and <unk> says mr. peters
but he wanted to pursue his own <unk> and he went
still mr. <unk> says his relationship with guber peters was one of the most successful i 've had in hollywood
the two have a <unk> <unk> <unk> is very <unk> and peter is very <unk> adds mr. <unk> who is now head of production at news corp. 's <unk> century fox film co
<unk> peters will come <unk> into a room say he 's got a great idea and be gone
peter will take the <unk> of that idea and make it grow into something specific
mr. <unk> recalls that mr. guber and mr. peters <unk> into high <unk> a few years back upon learning that they had competition for the story of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which became <unk> in the <unk>
he says within a few weeks we made deals with the government of <unk> and everyone who had ever met or talked to <unk> <unk>
i think peter even made some deals with the <unk>
universal <unk> was working on a competing film but the studio and its producers ultimately agreed to <unk> the film with guber peters and warner
more recently guber peters beat out a dozen other producers reportedly including robert <unk> and ted turner for rights to the life story of <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> union leader who <unk> developers in the <unk> <unk> forest
messrs. guber and peters <unk> <unk> the man 's <unk> for months showing her a tape of <unk> in the <unk> to <unk> her with the quality of their work
money helped too
ultimately they paid more than $ N million for the rights
the sale caused a <unk> between the <unk> and some of her husband 's <unk>
some of the money will go to the <unk> <unk> foundation but it is n't <unk> for groups trying to save the <unk> forest
it 's hardly <unk> given the men 's track record that sony wants mr. guber and mr. peters
but it is <unk> to some hollywood executives that sony <unk> to hire them without clearing up the warner situation first
some note that sony might have <unk> itself some trouble by just hiring mr. guber and letting mr. peters stay on to <unk> the warner contract
but though people in town may ask why guber needs peters it 's good to have a partner and obviously the <unk> works says steven <unk> a producer who once worked for mr. guber
this business is n't about <unk> at the end of the day it s about whether the <unk> is red or black
in the case of peter and <unk> the <unk> has been very very black
mr. guber got his start in the movie business at columbia two decades ago
<unk> from new york university 's <unk> program he rose within two years to head of production <unk> such <unk> as the way we were <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
in N he <unk> up with record producer <unk> bogart in <unk> records and <unk> later called <unk> pictures where they produced such hits as as the deep and <unk> express
in N mr. guber got together with mr. peters by then a successful producer in his own right after the death of mr. bogart
while guber peters produced a number of hits for warner and others their record was n't always so <unk>
among their <unk> were the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> bear
and the failures make it possible for warner in its current lawsuit to <unk> the producers as <unk>
the studio says it stuck with them even in the early years when the creative partnership was not particularly profitable for warner
mr. guber <unk> that this is a <unk> this time warner trying to <unk> up two <unk> who have done only well for them for a long period of time
mr. guber and mr. peters maintain that executives at warner have always known of their <unk> to run a major entertainment <unk> but that warner never felt threatened until they linked up with sony
from the beginning they knew we had a goal and a <unk> says mr. guber
on a number of <unk> he adds he tried to get warner to buy guber peters <unk>
they always <unk> but they never <unk> mr. guber says
in N mr. guber and mr. peters contributed their company 's assets in exchange for a N N stake in <unk> entertainment a <unk> tv production company controlled by giant industries inc. chairman <unk> <unk>
in july a year later warner agreed to release the producers from their old contract when messrs. guber peters and <unk> made a $ N million offer to buy N N of mgm\/ua
mr. guber and mr. peters planned to run the nearly <unk> mgm studio and the two even tried to interest warner <unk> president <unk> <unk> in becoming a partner after he advised them on the deal
but the mgm plan collapsed just two weeks later
mr. guber and mr. peters say they got a look at the books and <unk> at the price
their relationship with mr. <unk> <unk> shortly <unk>
last may he sold his N N stake in <unk> to a passive australian investor and <unk> was <unk> guber peters entertainment co
meanwhile mr. guber and mr. peters had agreed to extend their warner agreement with the new five-year exclusive contract
the new deal was considered the most <unk> of its kind both financially and in terms of creative freedom
but it <unk> by comparison to what sony was to offer last month the chance at last to run a major studio about $ N million in <unk> compensation up to N N of columbia 's future cash flow N N of the future appreciation of columbia 's market value and annual salaries of $ N million for each
the producers ' N N share of publicly held guber peters would net them an additional $ N million
sony also agreed to <unk> the producers against any liability to warner
sony is paying a hefty price for a company that had revenue of only $ N million last year
and earnings have been <unk>
in the the latest quarter thanks in part to <unk> guber peters earned $ N million or N cents a share compared to a loss of $ N million or N cents a share in last year 's quarter
guber peters stock which traded as low as $ N a share last year closed yesterday at $ N
the two sides now are <unk> each other of <unk>
mr. guber and mr. peters claim they have an <unk> agreement with warner executives that allows them to <unk> their contract should the opportunity to run a major studio <unk>
but in <unk> filed yesterday in the los angeles court mr. ross warner <unk> chairman robert daly and president <unk> deny that such an <unk> agreement was ever made
warner in its court filings calls it a piece of <unk> created for this litigation
mr. daly in his <unk> acknowledges that warner agreed to release the producers last year to take over mgm but says that situation was <unk> different
for one thing according to mr. daly the producers requested a release in advance
moreover the old contract was about to expire and the <unk> of guber peters pictures for warner was n't as strong as it is now
warner itself was in negotiations with mgm over certain movie and other rights and it was in warner 's interest to <unk> mgm\/ua guber and peters by <unk> them to become mgm executives mr. daly said in his <unk>
warner obviously does n't think that it is in its own interests to let mr. guber and mr. peters go off to columbia
at the very least mr. ross clearly sees an opportunity to use the two men to get a pound of <unk> from sony
during settlement talks for example warner <unk> such things as cable tv rights to columbia movies and columbia 's interest in the studio it jointly owns with warner according to executives involved in the talks
in any settlement warner is almost certain to demand rights to most of the N or so projects mr. guber and mr. peters have <unk> up for the next few years <unk> <unk> to <unk>
mr. guber and mr. peters <unk> to <unk> that they may have made a <unk> error in <unk> the sony offer before taking it up with warner
and they say there are plenty of <unk> in hollywood for letting people out of contracts
the last time columbia pictures was looking for a studio chief they note warner released producer david <unk> from his contract then took him back after he was subsequently fired by his <unk> at columbia
in his <unk> filed yesterday warner 's mr. ross indicated he is n't buying any such argument if sony succeeds here no written contract in hollywood will be worth the paper it 's written on
the sales <unk> could n't sound better
first there 's the name asset-backed securities
better than all those offers you get to buy securities backed by nothing
and there 's more
the assets backing the securities come from some of the country 's biggest and most secure institutions
most earn high ratings from credit agencies
their yields are higher than those of u.s. treasury issues
and the <unk> market has already attracted many of the nation 's biggest institutional investors
ready to jump
well think twice
the concept may be simple take a <unk> of loans <unk> them up in one <unk> package and sell pieces of the package to investors
but the <unk> may be misleading
<unk> say the slightly higher returns are n't enough to <unk> for the extra risk
they <unk> that asset-backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them and those are hard to <unk>
moreover the securities were introduced only about N N years ago the biggest <unk> is how they will fare in a recession
a lot of this stuff really is in <unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> director of the investment securities division of the u.s. comptroller of the currency
we do n't know how this whole market will work in a serious economic downturn
such concerns however have n't stopped asset-backed securities from becoming one of wall street 's <unk> new products
since the spring of N financial <unk> have <unk> a wide variety of debt into these new securities
they have sold issues backed by car loans <unk> loans and <unk> loans
they have offered <unk> of <unk> loans as well as packages of loans used to buy <unk> <unk>
last year there was an issue of <unk> bonds securities backed by loans to <unk> <unk>
some predict there will be third world bonds backed by loans to <unk> <unk> and other <unk> nations
and the biggest volume this year has been on securities backed by credit-card receivables sometimes known as plastic bonds
this is the <unk> of debt says james grant editor of grant 's interest rate <unk> a newsletter
before the sun sets on the <unk> it seems nothing will be left <unk>
the result is a $ N billion market according to securities data co
that includes more than $ N billion issued through august of this year up sharply from $ N billion in the comparable N period and more than in all of N
most issues have been sold to professional money managers pension funds bank trust departments and other institutions
but <unk> individuals also have been <unk> in and <unk> brokers have been pushing smaller investors into the asset-backed market
the <unk> <unk> is <unk> issues typically are sold in minimum <unk> of $ N
we expect additional offerings of asset-backed securities <unk> toward individual investors says bill <unk> a senior vice president at shearson lehman hutton inc
the process typically begins when an institution such as <unk> or sears <unk> & co. takes a pool of credit-card or other receivables and sells them to a <unk> created trust
the trust then issues securities generally due in five years or less that are <unk> by wall street brokerage firms and offered to investors
issues typically come with credit <unk> such as a bank letter of credit and thus have received high credit ratings
<unk> say the <unk> market has opened up a valuable new source of funds to <unk> while providing a valuable new investment for individuals and institutions
asset-backed securities are an attractive investment compared to bank certificates of deposit or other corporate bonds says craig j. goldberg managing director and head of the asset-backed securities group at merrill lynch capital markets
but <unk> question whether asset-backed bonds offer sufficient <unk> to <unk> for the extra risks
consider a $ N million offering of N N securities issued last spring and backed by <unk> credit-card receivables
the <unk> issue offered a yield of only about N percentage point above <unk> treasury issues
on a $ N investment that 's a difference of only $ N a year
that kind of spread can be critical for money managers who buy bonds in large quantities and whose <unk> depends on <unk> the money manager across the street
but for individuals who buy much smaller amounts and care less about relative performance than in <unk> what they have that margin is <unk>
if you 're in the bond business playing the <unk> <unk> then even an extra N basis points N percentage point becomes an important consideration on a career basis says mr. grant
but if you 're an individual investing money and trying to get it back again then that is n't of <unk> importance
moreover the interest on asset-backed securities is fully <unk> while interest on treasury issues is <unk> at the state and local level
that 's why some investment managers such as alex powers a vice president of chase manhattan bank 's private banking division do n't <unk> most asset-backed issues for individuals in <unk> states such as new york or california
but mr. powers has purchased asset-backed issues for individuals with <unk> accounts such as retirement plans
he points out that institutions buying asset-backed issues in large quantities can earn higher <unk> over treasurys than individuals buying smaller amounts
another concern is liquidity or how easily a security can be <unk> into cash
the secondary or <unk> market for asset-backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for treasury issues
that could make it <unk> for investors who need to sell their holdings quickly before the securities mature
that 's particularly true analysts say for certain of the securities such as those backed by <unk> loans
you could see massive gyrations here because it 's such a <unk> traded market says <unk> s. paris a vice president of european investors inc. a new york <unk> firm
in addition an investor who wants to know the daily value of treasury bonds or corporate bonds traded on the new york stock exchange can simply check newspaper <unk>
there are n't any such <unk> for asset-backed securities
<unk> asset-backed securities <unk> another problem
investors for instance may <unk> assume that the bank or company that originally held the assets is <unk> the securities
it is n't
the front cover of the <unk> for the <unk> credit-card receivables offering points out in <unk> capital letters that the certificates represent an interest only in the <unk> created trust and do not represent interests in or <unk> of the banks <unk> <unk> citicorp or any affiliate <unk>
in other words if there 's a problem do n't expect <unk> to come to the rescue
the <unk> also notes that the securities are not guaranteed by any government agency
that means investors have to focus on the quality of the debt that lies <unk> the securities as well as on the credit <unk> for the issue and the credit ratings the issue has received
that also is n't easy
take the credit <unk> which typically include a bank letter of credit or insurance from a <unk> company
the letter of credit typically is not offered by the bank selling the assets to back the securities
nor does it cover the entire portfolio
details of credit <unk> vary widely from issue to issue
still they play a crucial role in winning top ratings for most asset-backed issues which in turn is why the yield above treasurys is so <unk>
but <unk> ask why you should <unk> buying this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yields on <unk> paper
when you buy an asset-backed issue you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into <unk> difficulties
if a bank 's credit rating was lowered because of say its loans to third world nations that could also affect the ratings liquidity and prices of the asset-backed issues that the bank <unk>
underwriters insist these issues are <unk> to <unk> extremely tough economic conditions
but despite the credit <unk> despite the high ratings some money managers still worry that a recession could <unk> <unk> on the underlying assets
at a time when americans are leveraged to their <unk> asset-backed investors may be taking a <unk> gamble that consumers will be able to <unk> loans in hard times
at the very least a recession would <unk> investors to buy the <unk> bonds they can find that is treasurys
that could <unk> the yield spread between treasurys and asset-backed securities as well as make it tougher to <unk> the <unk>
but it could be much worse
some analysts are especially wary of credit-card issues
for one thing credit-card loans are unsecured
in addition they fear that banks have been <unk> to issue cards to the public giving cards to too many big <unk> who will default during a recession
a day of <unk> is coming where we think the market will place a high premium on the <unk> debt issues and therefore we think the best debt investment is u.s. government bonds says craig <unk> of <unk> futures inc. an investment advisory firm
what about <unk> asset-backed issues
<unk> we still say to stick with treasurys mr. <unk> <unk>
ratings he notes are subject to change

if you force financial planners to sum up their most important advice in a single sentence it would probably be a <unk> sentence <unk>
<unk> by a poll of wall street journal readers conducted this summer by <unk> & morgan inc. serious investors have taken that advice to heart
nearly N investors responded to the journal 's poll providing an <unk> look at their portfolios
those portfolios are <unk> <unk>
by <unk> their wealth among several investment alternatives the respondents have protected themselves against <unk> in any one area be it stocks bonds or real estate
for example about N N of journal readers owned stock down slightly from N N in a similar poll last year
but only N N said they had more than half their money in the stock market
<unk> N N of respondents own shares in a money-market mutual fund and N N own municipal bonds
but only N N to N N of the investors were <unk> more than half their funds to either of those alternatives
the poll conducted aug. N also provides a <unk> into the thinking of serious investors on a variety of other <unk>
it found them in a cautious but not <unk> mood
of N people sent a <unk> N <unk>
the response rate more than N N allows the results to be interpreted with a high degree of confidence
the results ca n't be <unk> to all investors though
journal readers are relatively <unk> with a <unk> household income of between $ N and $ N
nearly half of the respondents N N said their investment portfolio was worth $ N or more and N N said it was worth $ N million or more
the respondents were <unk> optimistic about the economy and investment markets but their <unk> <unk> were a <unk> more <unk> than they were a year ago
for example N N of this year 's respondents said they expect a recession within N months
last year only N N were expecting a recession
an additional N N of this year 's respondents expect the economy to slow down during the next N months
only N N of last year 's respondents anticipated slowing growth
apparently the respondents do n't think that an economic slowdown would <unk> the major investment markets very much
a <unk> majority N N think stock prices will be higher in august N than they were in august N
their <unk> on real estate is almost the same
some N N expect real estate in their local area to increase in value over the next N months
by contrast only N N expect an increase in the price of gold
since gold <unk> to <unk> when inflation is high that finding suggests that people believe inflation remains under control
even though only N N actually predicted a recession many respondents were taking a <unk> <unk> investment stance
nearly a third said they have made some portfolio changes to anticipate a possible recession
for the most part the changes were slight
the two-thirds who have n't tried to make their portfolios more <unk> were split about <unk> between investors who do n't believe in trying to predict the markets about N N and investors who do n't expect a recession about N N or are <unk> if and when a recession might come about N N
a <unk> approach to stocks continues to be the rule among respondents
most own two to N stocks and buy or sell no more than three times a year
some N N had bought some stock in the past year only N N had sold any
but the <unk> shadow of N 's stock-market crash still seems <unk>
about N N considered another crash likely while about N N said one is unlikely
those <unk> hardly changed from the previous year 's poll
and the respondents ' commitment to the stock market remains somewhat <unk> than usual
about N N of them said they would <unk> have at least N N of their money in stocks
but as of august only N N actually had stock-market investments of that size
most stock-market <unk> were <unk> <unk> <unk> at around the time of the poll
but it appears that many journal readers were taking that news as a sign to be cautious rather than a signal to jump on the <unk>

what should i do
get out of the possibly <unk> building to the parking lot

one sign of a possible easing of credit policy was the decision this week of people 's bank of china the central bank to <unk> $ N billion in short-term loans to pay farmers for the <unk> <unk> the official china daily reported
but while <unk> more money into the economy would bring relief to many industries it also runs the risk of <unk> another period of <unk> growth and steep inflation
the cycle has been repeated several times since china began <unk> its planned economy in N

two of the major ways that <unk> managed to <unk> these ends were to <unk> the <unk> treatment of capital gains and to <unk> the use of paper losses also known as passive losses that made many tax <unk> possible
many other tax benefits also were <unk> away
this year congress with <unk> from president bush has been busy trying to put many of these same tax <unk> back into the code
it appears likely that this year or next some form of capital-gains preference and <unk> <unk> will be enacted
other tax benefits probably will be restored and created
the main <unk> is finding a way to pay for them
the <unk> act was a <unk>
they wanted reform and they got a revolution says overhaul <unk> rep. <unk> <unk> r. ohio

mr. <unk> thinks so

the panamanian affair is only the <unk> of a more <unk> <unk>
it <unk> in a bush administration decision not to <unk> the u.s. congress and avoid at all costs being accused of <unk> in the region
the result has been a dangerous <unk> of u.s. leadership which leaves central america open to soviet <unk>
the influence of the u.s. is not being felt in central america washington 's decisions do not respond to a policy and are <unk> from reality says <unk> <unk> a costa <unk> congressman and former foreign minister
the <unk> of the bush administration 's latin <unk> was <unk> in the failure of the organization of american states to <unk> <unk> gen. noriega
faced with this <unk> u.s. <unk> expressed confidence that the <unk> <unk> group of south american nations which <unk> last week in <unk> would take a stronger <unk> toward the panamanian dictator

formally <unk> the <unk> to a democratic status was an initiative <unk> criticized in the costa <unk> press
even carlos <unk> <unk> the presidential candidate for mr. <unk> 's national <unk> party made public his opposition to the presence of nicaragua in a democratic <unk>
nevertheless the bush administration agreed to the <unk> arrangement in july a few weeks before the central american <unk> met in <unk> <unk> to discuss a <unk> for <unk> the <unk> rebels

aid was also the <unk> of the talks sen. <unk> had with <unk> president <unk> <unk> mr. <unk> 's government is very much at the <unk> of u.s. <unk> and is forced to listen very carefully to sen. <unk> 's <unk> and <unk>
it was therefore not surprising that close allies of the u.s. virtually <unk> by the bush administration ordered the <unk> <unk> <unk> by december long before the elections
<unk> the <unk> <unk> were <unk> by <unk> the <unk> plan
the individual foreign policy carried out by u.s. legislators adds to a <unk> u.s. performance that has <unk> soviet <unk> in central america

since mr. shevardnadze 's proposals followed discussions with mr. baker <unk> <unk> that the bush administration was seeking an <unk> with the soviets in central america
this scheme would fit the <unk> plan which declared a false <unk> between soviet military aid to the <unk> <unk> and that provided by washington to <unk> elected governments

in the <unk> <unk> gave nicaragua another powerful radio <unk> which has been installed in the city of <unk>
it is <unk> of <unk> the entire <unk> area and deep into north america
perhaps its <unk> signal may generate some <unk> of the soviet <unk> being created in the <unk> thanks to u.s. default
the soviet <unk> in nicaragua is <unk> for costa <unk> a <unk> democracy without an army
questioned in washington about what would happen if his <unk> peace plan would fail president <unk> <unk> expectations of direct u.s. action
a poll conducted in july by a <unk> affiliate showed that N N of costa <unk> believe that if their country is <unk> <unk> by either nicaragua or panama the u.s. will come to its defense

the prices of corn futures contracts jumped amid rumors that the soviet union is keeping up its <unk> october buying <unk> of u.s. corn
those rumors were confirmed after the end of trading yesterday when the u.s. agriculture department announced that the soviets had bought N million metric tons of u.s. corn bringing their u.s. corn purchases confirmed so far this month to about five million metric tons
in trading at the chicago board of trade the corn contract for december delivery jumped N cents a <unk> to settle at $ N a <unk>
the soviet purchases are close to exceeding what some analysts had expected the soviet union to buy this fall the season in which it usually buys much of the corn it imports from the u.s.
that pace is causing some analysts to <unk> that the soviet union might soon purchase as much as another two million metric tons
one sign that more soviet purchases are possible is that u.s. grain companies yesterday bought an unusually large amount of corn futures contracts
that sometimes <unk> that they are <unk> plans to export corn
by some estimates several grain companies combined bought contracts for the <unk> of roughly one million metric tons of corn
by buying futures contracts these companies attempt to protect themselves from swings in the price of the corn that they are <unk> to deliver
rumors of soviet interest also pushed up the prices of <unk> futures contracts
among other things the agriculture department is widely thought to be <unk> whether to <unk> the sale of <unk> oil to the soviet union
on top of all this corn and <unk> prices rose on reports that the <unk> <unk> was <unk> by a <unk> early <unk> storm that dumped several <unk> in parts of <unk> and ohio
the <unk> delays however are expected to be temporary
<unk> <unk> are forecast for next week said robert <unk> an analyst at farmers grain & <unk> corp. chicago
many farmers used the jump in prices to sell their recently <unk> <unk> to grain <unk> companies
the heavy selling by farmers helped to <unk> the price rally
<unk> futures prices rose slightly
in other commodity markets yesterday
precious metals
futures prices declined
a number of developments were <unk> interpreted by traders
december delivery gold fell $ N an ounce to $ N
december silver eased N cents an ounce to $ N
january platinum was down $ N an ounce at $ N
one <unk> development was the <unk> increase of only N N in the consumer price index for september an analyst said
he noted that the core inflation rate which <unk> food and energy was also low at N N
other news that <unk> on the market initial unemployment claims rose by N last week american telephone & telegraph co. will reduce its <unk> staff by N through <unk> the oil market turned weaker there was n't any investor demand for <unk> and the dollar <unk> during the day putting pressure on gold
also the analyst said economic circumstances are such that both south africa and the soviet union the principal gold and platinum producers are being forced to continue selling the metals
both are in great need of foreign exchange and south africa is also under pressure to meet foreign loan commitments he said
putting it all together we have a negative scenario that does n't look like it will improve overnight he said
copper
futures prices recovered in quiet trading
the december contract rose N cents a pound to $ N
that contract fell a total of N cents during the first three days of this week mostly in reaction to last friday 's stock market plunge which prompted concern that it might signal a similar sharp slowing of the u.s. economy and thus reduced demand for copper a leading industrial metal
in recent days however there has been increased purchasing of copper in london an analyst said
some of this buying was by japan which has had its supplies sharply reduced by long production <unk> at the <unk> mine in <unk> new <unk> <unk> valley mine in british columbia and the <unk> mine in mexico which are major shippers to japan
the increasing <unk> that <unk> and <unk> valley will soon return to production may have cut some of that purchasing but even if any of these mines begin operating soon their output wo n't be significant until at least the end of the year analysts note
so one analyst said even though the long-term production problems may be easing there will still be a significant need for copper over the next three months when inventories will remain relatively low
energy

west texas <unk> for november delivery fell N cents a barrel to $ N

<unk> <unk> 's san francisco law offices may have been the epicenter of legal activity after tuesday 's earthquake
in the first N minutes after his office 's telephone service was restored yesterday morning N potential clients had called seeking the services of the <unk> king of <unk>
mr. <unk> like many other <unk> lawyers <unk> that the earthquake which measured N on the richter scale will generate enough lawsuits to keep this city 's <unk> and construction lawyers busy for quite some time
suits are likely to be filed against engineering firms contractors and developers as well as against <unk> agencies
but lawyers looking to cash in on the quake may have a tough time once their cases reach a judge
experts on california <unk> law say <unk> <unk> government agencies in such cases are pretty <unk>
even claims against individuals and companies face significant <unk>
the major legal barrier is the principle that no one can be held <unk> for an act of <unk>
for now says <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> california trial lawyers association the last thing we really need to worry about is whether anybody is going to get sued or whether they have liability or not
we still have people <unk> around in a <unk> in san francisco <unk> about whether it 's going to <unk> <unk>
but that wo n't stop plaintiffs ' lawyers from seeking a little room for <unk>
in san francisco they argue an earthquake was a near <unk>
therefore engineering firms construction contractors and developers can be sued for not keeping structures up to standard and government agencies can be held <unk> for failing to <unk> protect citizens from such a <unk> disaster if <unk> can be proven
my <unk> is there will be mass litigation over <unk> and <unk> in engineering and <unk> says stanley <unk> a well-known cincinnati plaintiffs lawyer
from what he saw on television mr. <unk> points out that interstate N which collapsed and killed more than N commuters suffered serious damage while surrounding buildings appeared to <unk> no damage <unk>
he adds that they were aware of the <unk> for earthquakes and the san <unk> fault
the <unk> and <unk> mr. <unk> says he already has investigators looking into who could be held <unk> for the damage on the bay bridge and the interstate <unk> it
we wo n't know until the smoke <unk> but yes we 're looking into it he says
mr. <unk> says he wants to know whether state or federal engineers or private companies could have <unk> the damage
mr. <unk> who was at <unk> park for the world series tuesday night says he has hired civil engineers to check out his own <unk> damaged building and to <unk> the bridge collapse
defense lawyers perhaps <unk> say that plaintiffs ' lawyers taking such an approach will have little success in pursuing their claims though they add that the facts of each case must be looked at <unk>
a lot of this is going to be <unk> says <unk> j. <unk> a construction law specialist at <unk> <unk> & <unk> a san francisco law firm
plaintiffs he says will argue that damaged structures were n't built to <unk> design standards
but if defendants can prove that they met san francisco 's <unk> building <unk> that 's probably going to protect them mr. <unk> says
government <unk> continues mr. <unk> could be protected by the california government <unk> liability act
under the <unk> agencies are provided <unk> that normally are n't available in the private sector mr. <unk> says
the legislature does not want to <unk> the <unk> government activities by <unk> public <unk> to liability
built into the <unk> are so-called design <unk> which are likely to protect government agencies according to mr. <unk> and richard <unk> a lawyer with the california department of transportation which <unk> the damaged bay bridge
the state is protected when plans and designs for public structures were approved ahead of time or when structures met previously approved standards says mr. <unk>
he believes those <unk> might well apply to the bay bridge collapse
nevertheless he adds i would n't get totally <unk> if we get lawsuits out of the bay bridge
if there 's going to be a race to the <unk> it has n't started yet
mr. <unk> had to search through law books <unk> on the floor of his office yesterday and mr. <unk> 's <unk> was <unk> with <unk>

the british deloitte firm recently withdrew from the merger of deloitte and <unk> world-wide and joined coopers & <unk>
john <unk> senior partner of deloitte in the u.k. said the decision to start these proceedings has n't been taken <unk>
mr. <unk> said the british firm has used the name deloitte since N
in the u.s. deloitte <unk> & sells was known as <unk> & sells until N when it added the deloitte name of its british affiliate
john c. <unk> an accounting professor at columbia university 's <unk> school of business said there 's a lot of <unk> involved in the name of an accounting firm with a long history and with <unk> in england where accounting <unk> the u.s.

j. michael <unk> chairman of deloitte <unk> & sells international said he believes the legal action by the british firm to be without <unk>
mr. <unk> said that last june the international executive <unk> of deloitte and <unk> agreed to a world-wide merger
the merger is <unk> according to plan except as to the withdrawal of the deloitte u.k. firm he said
partners at other accounting firms say that the deloitte firm in the u.k. is filing the suit to get even with the merged <unk> firm for keeping major <unk> work in england
general motors corp. a deloitte audit client for example has agreed to keep its annual $ N million world-wide audit and associated tax work with the merged <unk> firm to be known as deloitte & <unk> in the u.s.
in england this would mean that the british deloitte would lose revenue for its audit of gm 's <unk> unit
the <unk> of deloitte 's affiliates in britain and the netherlands to coopers & <unk> will make coopers one of the biggest accounting firms in europe <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> there
although coopers has n't been <unk> by other major accounting firms for a merger it is <unk> greatly from <unk> from the <unk> merger
in new york harris <unk> general counsel of coopers said coopers was aware of the litigation but he declined further comment
he also declined to comment on the name that coopers would use in england if deloitte <unk> won its litigation to keep its name

tuesday 's <unk> of a gop congressional <unk> in a <unk> district that has n't backed a democratic presidential candidate since <unk> <unk> is another <unk> that at least at the federal level political ticket <unk> has been on the rise over the past half century
in only one presidential election year prior to N did more than N N of the nation 's congressional districts choose a different party 's candidate for the white house than for the house of representatives
now that percentage <unk> <unk> a third and twice has been above N N
as we know voters tend to favor republicans more in races for president than in those for congress
in every presidential election over the past half century except for the <unk> presidential <unk> the gop has <unk> a greater percentage of the <unk> popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for congress
prior to N the pattern was nearly the <unk>
what accounts for the results of recent decades
a simple economic theory may provide at least a partial <unk> for the split <unk> <unk> by americans in the voting <unk>
the theory <unk> on three <unk>
N voters can buy one of two brands when they select their political agents a republican brand that believes in the <unk> state and in the <unk> of private markets over the <unk> of public action and a democratic brand that believes in big government and in public <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> to the pursuit of private interest
N congressional representatives have two basic <unk> while voting in office dealing with national issues <unk> actions such as <unk> roll call votes on legislation that <unk> costs <unk> <unk> benefits on the population at large and <unk> to local issues <unk> service and <unk> barrel
N republican congressional representatives because of their belief in a <unk> state are less willing to <unk> in local <unk> than are democratic members of congress
if these <unk> hold voters in races for congress face what in economic theory is called a <unk> 's <unk> and have an <unk> at the margin to <unk> democratic
if they put a republican into office not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected <unk> will be relatively <unk> to prevent other legislators from bringing home the <unk> to their <unk> <unk>
each <unk> after all is only one out of N when it comes to national policy making
in races for the white house a <unk> 's <unk> at the margin is to <unk> republican
although a gop president may limit local benefits to the <unk> 's particular <unk> such a president is also likely to be more effective at <unk> other <unk> and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits
the individual <unk> 's standing <unk> will be enhanced through lower taxes
while this theory is <unk> simple it appears to explain several things
first why ticket <unk> has increased and taken the <unk> pattern that it has over the past half century prior to the election of franklin <unk> as president and the <unk> of the new deal government <unk> a much smaller role in society and the <unk> 's <unk> problem <unk> voters in races for congress was <unk> less severe
second it <unk> why voters hold congress in <unk> but generally love their own congressional representatives any individual <unk> 's <unk> <unk> the specific benefits that the <unk> <unk> for them but not the overall cost associated with every other <unk> doing <unk> for his own <unk>
third the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local <unk> have lower security in office
for example <unk> members of the house once the most vulnerable of <unk> have become virtually immune to <unk>
the one <unk> to this recent trend was the <unk> of N of the N <unk> republicans brought into office in N by the reagan revolution and running for <unk> in N
because these <unk> placed far more <unk> on their <unk> role <unk> the reagan revolution in national policy making they were more vulnerable to <unk>
fourth the theory indicates why the republican party may have a difficult time <unk> <unk> candidates for congressional office
potential candidates may be <unk> from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of <unk> at the hands of a democratic <unk>
to the extent that potential republican candidates and their financial <unk> realize that the congressional <unk> 's <unk> game works to their <unk> the republican party will be <unk> in its attempts to field a competitive <unk> of congressional candidates
fifth the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket <unk> has been particularly <unk> in the south
to the extent that democratic legislators from the south have held a <unk> share of power in congress since N and have been able to <unk> such <unk> into relatively more local benefits for their <unk> <unk> voters in the south have had an especially strong <unk> to keep such democrats in office
finally the theory suggests why republicans generally have <unk> better in senate races than in campaigns for the house
since local <unk> matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of congress this is <unk> the pattern one would expect if republicans are less willing to <unk> in local <unk> than their democratic <unk>
is there any <unk> support for this theory
three pieces of evidence <unk> the key assumption that democratic legislators are more willing to <unk> in local <unk> than their republican colleagues
first economists james bennett and thomas <unk> find that gop senators turn back roughly N N more of their <unk> personal staff <unk> than democrats do
to the extent that the primary duty of personal staff <unk> local <unk> this indicates that political <unk> leads congressional republicans to pay less attention to narrow <unk> concerns
second if the key assumption is <unk> democrats should have lower <unk> rates on <unk> votes than republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a <unk> could otherwise <unk> to local <unk>
this is indeed what the data indicate particularly in the case of the house
the democratic house <unk> rate has not exceeded the republican house <unk> rate since N
finally as shown in the table democrats <unk> a higher <unk> of their personal <unk> to district offices where local <unk> duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to washington offices
an <unk> of changes in personal <unk> decisions in the senate between N and N when control of that body changed party hands moreover <unk> that the personal <unk> differences noted in the table can not be attributed to the <unk> control democrats exercise due to their <unk> status over other resources such as committee staff
an additional piece of evidence from the senate holding other factors <unk> such as <unk> <unk> and regional factors the difference between popular votes for republican presidential and <unk> candidates in states conducting a senate election turns out to be a positive <unk> of how <unk> the federal government 's tax burden is per state a <unk> tax rate hits <unk> states harder
put more simply gop candidates for president are looked on more <unk> by voters than republican candidates for the senate when the <unk> 's <unk> is more severe
moreover ticket <unk> appears to take the same <unk> pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level
state government is more typically split along <unk> lines than the reverse
a <unk> <unk> investigation <unk> <unk> that holding other factors <unk> the difference between a state 's <unk> vote going to the republican <unk> candidate and the republican share of the lower state house is a positive <unk> of the state tax rate
in sum at both the federal and state government levels at least part of the <unk> <unk> behavior voters display in the voting <unk> may have an <unk> <unk> <unk>
mr. <unk> <unk> at the university of southern california 's business school
a house-senate conference approved a nearly $ N billion state justice and commerce department bill that makes federal <unk> for <unk> held in world war ii <unk> <unk> a legal <unk> after next oct. N
the measure provides no money for the promised payments until then but beginning in fiscal N the government would be committed to meeting annual payments of as much as $ N million until the total liability of approximately $ N billion is paid
the action <unk> earlier efforts to find <unk> cuts to fund the payments but is widely seen as a more <unk> means of <unk> <unk> first authorized in N
the action came as congress sent to president bush a fiscal N bill providing an estimated $ N billion for the departments of labor education health and human services
final approval was on a N roll call in the senate which sets the stage for a veto <unk> with mr. bush over the issue of publicly financed abortions for poor women
<unk> an <unk> federal policy the measure <unk> <unk> abortions in cases of rape and incest but mr. bush has so far refused to support any specific <unk> beyond <unk> in which the mother 's life is in danger
mr. bush 's veto power puts him a <unk> position in the narrowly divided house but a vote to <unk> his position could well pick up new support because of the wealth of health and education programs financed in the underlying bill
the measure before the conference yesterday funds the departments of state justice and commerce through fiscal N
an estimated $ N billion is provided for next year 's census and <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> seeking to block the <unk> of illegal <unk>
elsewhere in the commerce department nearly $ N million is <unk> for assistance programs under the economic development administration
and in a <unk> to the fall of house speaker james <unk> this year the conference voted to <unk> $ N million in <unk> <unk> funds for a <unk> worth texas <unk> project that figured in ethics charges against the former democratic leader
fiscal pressures also forced the <unk> of new fees charged by federal agencies and an N N increase in the securities and exchange commission 's budget would be financed entirely by an added $ N million in filing fees
in an unprecedented step the measure <unk> another $ N million in receipts by having the federal bureau of investigation charge for <unk> services in civil cases a change that is almost certain to increase pentagon costs in processing personnel and security <unk>
the bill does n't include an estimated $ N billion in <unk> <unk> funds for justice department and <unk> accounts that are still in conference with the house
but yesterday 's agreement would make it easier for state governments to handle the promised aid by <unk> for one year a scheduled N N increase in the required state matching funds for <unk> grants
<unk> the measure <unk> the current funding formula to promise smaller states such as new hampshire and delaware a minimum <unk> of $ N million each in drug grants or three times the current minimum
the <unk> mix of departments in the bill makes it one of the more <unk> of the annual appropriations measures and the <unk> provisions attached by lawmakers run from $ N million for a <unk> farm in arkansas to a music <unk> in moscow under the united states information agency
lawmakers <unk> all of a $ N million state department request for the N <unk> in <unk> spain but agreed elsewhere to $ N for an oil <unk> of former chief justice <unk> <unk>
senate commerce committee chairman <unk> <unk> d. <unk> who also <unk> the senate appropriations subcommittee for the department attached $ N million for an advanced technology initiative including work on high-definition television
his republican <unk> sen. <unk> <unk> r. <unk> has used his position to wage a legislative war with the conservative board of the legal services corp
an estimated $ N million is provided to maintain the program but mr. <unk> also succeeded in <unk> language seeking to curb the authority of the current board until new members are confirmed
the effective date of any new regulations by the current board would be delayed until oct. N next year and the bill seeks to reverse efforts by the corporation to cut off funds to service organizations such as the food research and action center
the bill also provides $ N million to meet u.s. contributions to international organizations and $ N million for <unk> activities
both accounts reflect significant increases from fiscal N although the amount for <unk> shows a N N cut from the administration 's request
<unk> savings & loan association said it retained merrill lynch capital markets as its lead investment banker to <unk> it regarding a possible sale or other combination of the <unk> beach calif. thrift

watching congress <unk> and <unk> through its annual budget <unk> fighting the urge to spend more we 're <unk> of those <unk> movies in which the <unk> serial <unk> turns himself in to police and says stop me before i kill again

we can <unk> mr. <unk> 's moment of <unk> even as we understand that he and his <unk> need <unk> <unk> they kill again
a good place to start the <unk> is a legislative <unk> veto bill now being offered by <unk> senator <unk> <unk>
the <unk> bill which already has N senate <unk> is n't a <unk> <unk> veto because it would apply only to spending bills
instead it 's a form of enhanced <unk> giving a president a chance to <unk> or strike specific spending items that just go too far
under the proposal a president would have a chance twice each year to return a package of <unk> to the hill once when he <unk> his budget and again after congress <unk>
congress would have N days to <unk> the package with a N N majority but then a president could veto that rejection
congress would then need the usual two-thirds majority to <unk> any veto
the proposal would restore some discipline <unk> from the budget process by the N budget reform act
before N a president could <unk> or <unk> to spend funds <unk> by congress
<unk> kennedy and johnson were both big users of the <unk> power but congress saw its chance against a weakened president <unk> and <unk> it away
today a president can still send up spending <unk> but they 're <unk> unless congress has a guilty <unk> and changes its mind
this is like asking <unk> to feel <unk> about <unk> and naturally <unk> are almost never approved
in N president reagan sent N <unk> back to the hill but only N N of the spending total was approved by congress
senator <unk> 's proposal would let the proposed spending cuts take place automatically unless congress acts
the members could still try to serve their <unk> with <unk> <unk> but the police in the form of a president would be there with a <unk> if they really get <unk> as they do now

the coalition would include the current <unk> <unk> <unk> regime the two <unk> resistance groups led by son <unk> and prince <unk> and the khmer rouge
the aim would be to end the <unk> war for control of <unk> by allowing the khmer rouge a small share of power
the state department says that any khmer rouge participation would have to be minimal
the usual problem with including communists in <unk> coalition governments is that their <unk> and methods require they squeeze out everyone else

what <unk> the scene in <unk> is that the current regime is already communist as are its <unk> <unk> back in <unk> as are the khmer rouge who are the strongest of the three <unk> groups
it 's not clear which <unk> of communists might <unk> in a coalition government but the one good bet is that the <unk> would <unk>

the <unk> <unk> was so bad that the <unk> <unk> in N was a <unk> form of relief
the world might want to believe that the khmer rouge ca n't still be such bad guys just as in the late 1970s it was reluctant to credit the reports of <unk> then taking place

bankamerica corp. reported a N N jump in third-quarter earnings as its <unk> recovery from nearly <unk> losses several years ago continued to be <unk> by growth in consumer loans higher interest margins and <unk> loan losses
for the quarter bankamerica said it earned $ N million or $ N a share compared with $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier
bankamerica <unk> said preliminary reports indicate the company was n't <unk> affected by the tuesday earthquake
all but eight of the N branches which had some structural damage <unk> yesterday for business
<unk> <unk> machine operations also were up and operating yesterday a bank spokesman said
for the first time in nearly two years bankamerica results failed to improve in consecutive quarters but the decline from the second quarter was <unk> to special factors
third-quarter profit was N N below the $ N million or $ N a share earned in the N second quarter
the company cited higher tax credits in the second quarter totaling $ N million compared with $ N million in the third quarter
excluding tax credits profit was N N below the second quarter
but that drop was caused entirely by a decline in <unk> interest paid to $ N million from $ N million the second quarter
moreover bankamerica continued to build its reserve against troubled foreign loans by boosting its loan-loss provision to $ N million about the same as the previous quarter but well above the $ N million in the year-earlier quarter
the provision rate was far above bankamerica 's actual net credit losses of $ N million in the third quarter compared with $ N million in the second period and $ N million a year earlier
as a result bankamerica said its reserve against troubled <unk> loans once below N N now amounts to N N of the $ N billion of <unk> debt it <unk> it is owed by those nations
that level is about the same as some other big banks but far below the N N and N N reserves of bankers trust new york corp. and <unk> morgan & co. respectively
by any measure third-quarter earnings were still robust equivalent to a N N return on assets even excluding tax credits
by that key measure of operating <unk> bankamerica turned in a better performance than its <unk> los angeles-based <unk> security pacific corp. which posted a N N return in the third quarter
but it continued to badly <unk> its san francisco <unk> wells fargo & co. which reported an extraordinary N N return on assets
both returns do n't include any tax credits
they bankamerica continue to show good performance said donald <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> & <unk> inc. san francisco
in composite trading yesterday on the new york stock exchange bankamerica common stock edged up N cents to close at $ N a share
shareholder equity improved to N N from N N in the previous quarter
the N N net interest margin or the difference between the yield on a bank 's investments and the rate it pays for deposits and other <unk> was still <unk> higher than the N N ratio a year earlier and is among the best in the industry analysts said
the high margin partly <unk> from continued strong growth in <unk> consumer loans which jumped N N to $ N billion from a year earlier and residential mortgages which rose N N to $ N billion
bankamerica 's total loans rose N N to $ N billion
for the nine months bankamerica profit soared N N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share
international business machines corp. will announce on tuesday a <unk> of software products aimed at eliminating some of the major problems involved in <unk> manufacturing operations industry executives said
many plant <unk> currently <unk> a tower of <unk> with computers <unk> and machine tools that generally speak their own language and have trouble talking to each other
as a result if a problem <unk> on a production line it is unlikely some <unk> sitting in front of a personal computer or <unk> will know about it or be able to correct it
so ibm will be announcing more than N products that will be aimed at letting even the <unk> machine <unk> talk to the <unk> mainframe or anything in between
in an unusual display of <unk> ibm also will be helping customers <unk> together operations that include lots of equipment made by ibm 's competitors
in addition the executives said ibm will be offering programming tools designed to let anyone working on a factory floor write <unk> software for instance to do <unk> analysis that would <unk> a problem on a manufacturing line
in <unk> n.y. an ibm spokeswoman confirmed that ibm executives will be announcing some <unk> plans next week but declined to elaborate
the industry executives said that as usual with such broad announcements from ibm this one will be part reality and part strategy
so it will take many quarters for ibm to roll out all the products that customers need and it will take years for customers to <unk> the products into their operations
also as usual the products will appeal mostly to heavy users of ibm equipment at least initially
still consultants and industry executives said the products could help make manufacturing operations more efficient and provide a boost to the <unk> market a market that <unk> group a research firm has said may double to $ N billion by N
this is a step in the right direction said martin <unk> a <unk> group analyst
he added though that a lot of this is <unk>
we 'll have to wait and see how the plan <unk>
the announcements also should help ibm go on the <unk> against digital equipment corp. on the plant floor
while ibm has traditionally dominated the market for computers on the business side of manufacturing operations and has done well in the market for design tools digital has dominated <unk> manufacturing
hewlett-packard co. also has begun to gain share in the whole <unk> <unk>
ibm will face an <unk> climb against digital given digital 's reputation for being better than ibm at <unk> together different manufacturers ' computers
in addition hewlett-packard while a much smaller player has made a big commitment to the <unk> of industry standards that <unk> those <unk> and could give ibm some problems
both can be expected to go after the market aggressively <unk> group inc. a research firm estimated the digital gets N N of its revenue from the manufacturing market and hewlett-packard gets N N
ibm which <unk> group said <unk> N N of its revenue in this market should be able to take advantage of its loyal following among buyers of equipment
that is because many companies will <unk> on certain types of equipment as the various parts of the manufacturing market merge and ibm is the biggest player
but much will <unk> on how quickly ibm can move
the whole idea of <unk> manufacturing <unk> seems to be making a comeback after losing a little <unk> over the past couple of years when it became apparent that it was n't a <unk> that would make u.s. plants more efficient and <unk> foreign competition
<unk> <unk> a <unk> group analyst said <unk> changes may still be required to really take advantage of <unk> 's <unk> someone on the shop floor may not like having someone in an office using a personal computer to look over his <unk> for instance and may be able to prevent that from happening
but he said a system such as ibm 's should help significantly
in making <unk> <unk> out of plastic chips for instance a chip sometimes does n't <unk> gets caught in the machinery and <unk> a run in the <unk>
that can be expensive because the problem may not be noticed for a while and the <unk> are typically <unk> away
but mr. <unk> said that if computers can be integrated into the process they could <unk> an operator as soon as the problem occurred
they could also check through the orders on file to find a customer that was willing to accept a lower <unk> of <unk>
the computer would let the machine run just until that order was filled eliminating waste
this sort of improved link figures to eventually become a significant <unk> for some companies
companies might be able to tell salespeople daily for instance about idle equipment so they could offer <unk> on whatever that equipment produces
salespeople also could get a <unk> reading on when products could be delivered in much the same way that federal express has <unk> its ability to tell exactly where a package is in the delivery system
ford motor co. 's merkur the company 's first new car franchise in the u.s. since the <unk> was unveiled in N now will share <unk> 's <unk>
ford said yesterday it will halt imports of the merkur <unk> a $ N luxury <unk> built by ford of europe in west germany
the cars are sold under a separate franchise with its own sign in front of <unk> dealers as opposed to new models such as <unk> or <unk> which are sold under existing ford divisions
the move to halt imports announced N years and N months to the day after henry ford ii declared that the <unk> division and its <unk> car would be <unk> <unk> the <unk> merkur brand in the u.s. market
it will continue to be sold in the european market
merkur 's death is n't nearly as costly to ford as was the <unk> <unk> because merkur was a relatively <unk> project with limited sales goals
still merkur 's <unk> is a setback for ford at a time when the company 's image as the u.s. auto maker with the golden <unk> is showing signs of strain
the no. N auto maker 's new <unk> and <unk> <unk> models have n't met sales expectations in the year since they were introduced and ford 's trucks are losing ground to their gm rivals
this fall ford introduced only one new product a <unk> version of its <unk> lincoln town car luxury model
the <unk> of merkur <unk> <unk> comes after a september in which N merkur dealers managed to sell only N <unk>
total merkur sales for the first nine months dropped N N from a year ago to just N cars
merkur is n't the only european luxury brand having problems in the u.s.
the japanese <unk> on the luxury market is rapidly <unk> such european makes as <unk> and saab which at least have clear brand <unk>
merkur as an import on domestic car lots suffered from the same sort of image <unk> that is <unk> sales of imports at general motors corp. and chrysler corp
merkur was originally aimed at <unk> into <unk> <unk> the kind of young <unk> buyers who would n't be caught dead in a town car a vehicle so <unk> that ford is <unk> a press event next month <unk> the town car 's launch to the <unk> of a new aircraft carrier in norfolk <unk>
but the brand had trouble from the start
the first merkur the <unk> went on sale in early N
the <unk> <unk> <unk> in part because american buyers did n't go for the car 's unusual <unk> <unk> <unk>
in may N ford began <unk> the <unk> <unk> from west germany to sell next to a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
ford officials said they expected the two <unk> would sell about N cars a year and in N they reached that goal as sales hit N cars
it was <unk> from there however
one major factor was the decline of the dollar against the mark which began less than a year after merkur 's N launch
as the west german currency rose so did merkur prices
the merkur cars also suffered from <unk> quality some dealers say
it was like a <unk> of <unk> says martin j. <unk> <unk> a big dealer whose star <unk> operation in <unk> mich. sold more <unk> 's than any other <unk>
but by the third quarter of N <unk> had a high <unk> rating in internal ford studies a spokesman said
apparently however the improvement came too late
last fall ford announced it would <unk> the <unk> in the u.s. at the end of the N model year
ford said then it would keep the <unk>
this year <unk> sales plummeted and at the current sales pace it would take ford N days to sell off the current <unk> <unk> of about N cars

since then ual stock has fallen N N in what may <unk> as the largest collapse of a takeover stock ever
the <unk> of mr. stevens 's <unk> seemed to indicate that british air will take a more active <unk> role in pursuing any new bid
he said he believes ual management was badly advised on the funding of its original transaction
mr. stevens said british air has n't received any new buy-out proposals from the labor-management group led by ual chairman stephen wolf and has n't received any indication of when one might be <unk>
as far as we 're concerned we 're waiting for the <unk> to settle he said
although british air is waiting to see what the buy-out group comes up with mr. stevens said a revised transaction with less debt <unk> is likely to be more attractive to banks
he said the original proposal is dead and all aspects of a revised version are up for change in light of the changes in ual 's market price the amount of debt banks are willing to fund and the price british air would be willing to pay
mr. stevens said he expects the new price will be <unk> lower but declined to <unk> a figure
asked whether a $ <unk> figure <unk> in the market yesterday is too low he said it 's certainly not too low
he added the original offer was a pretty full price and that british air 's contribution was quite a large <unk> for us
british air was originally attracted to the chance of <unk> a N N stake in the company but was n't particularly happy with paying $ N million
if the new deal had us putting up less money but still having N N that would be a point in our favor he said
in any new proposal british air would expect a greater rate of return than the <unk> in the original proposal
in the event that the buy-out group <unk> in <unk> its bid the ual board could remain under some pressure to seek another transaction even without any legal obligation to do so
roughly one-third of its stock is believed held by takeover stock traders who could vote to <unk> the board if they become <unk>
meanwhile the buy-out group 's task of holding its <unk> coalition together in the face of the bid 's collapse and internal opposition from two other employee groups has been further complicated by an apparent <unk> in the <unk> of the pilot union itself
a pilot representing a group of N pilots hired during united 's N strike filed suit friday in chicago federal court to block the takeover
the dissident pilots oppose the plan because it would cause them to lose their <unk>
ual 's management agreed to reduce the <unk> of those pilots in exchange for the support of the united pilot union for the buy-out proposal
the N pilots involved in the suit are n't members of the union
the airline had allowed them to move ahead of some union members in <unk> following the N strike a move the union had <unk> in a previous lawsuit

corporate efforts to control health-care costs by requiring <unk> prior to planned <unk> and <unk> have n't been <unk> enough to reduce the long-term rate of cost increases according to a study by the institute of <unk>
in the last decade many corporations have <unk> the utilization management cost <unk> strategy as a way to control health-care costs for employees
these programs vary widely but often require second <unk> on proposed <unk> <unk> reviews of <unk> <unk> and reviews of treatment during <unk> or recovery periods
between N N and N N of today 's workers are covered by such plans up from N N five years ago
although it probably has reduced the level of expenditures for some <unk> utilization management like most other cost <unk> strategies does n't appear to have <unk> the long-term rate of increase in health-care costs the institute of <unk> an affiliate of the national academy of sciences concluded after a two-year study
employers who saw a short-term <unk> in benefit expenditures are seeing a return to previous trends
while utilization management frequently reduces <unk> costs these savings are often offset by increases in <unk> services and higher administrative costs according to the report by a panel of health-care experts
the report suggested that current review programs are too narrow
the <unk> and <unk> use of the hospital and not the actual need for a particular <unk> has been the main focus the panel said
as a general rule <unk> programs have not made <unk> <unk> of the <unk> costs of alternative <unk> or sites of care
the report said that utilization management should have more of an impact as federal research on the <unk> of medical <unk> helps lead to medical practice guidelines
howard <unk> a panel member and a vice president of <unk> life & casualty said that utilization management will also do a better job of <unk> costs as it <unk> to cover medical services delivered outside of hospitals
there 's pretty good evidence that utilization management has reduced <unk> <unk> he said
but at the same time spending on <unk> services and <unk> care have <unk>
it 's like <unk> a <unk> dr. <unk> said
david <unk> of a. <unk> <unk> & co. said that clients of his consulting firm report that utilization management reduces their hospital care bills by about N N but he agreed that for the health-care system as whole some of these savings are offset by administrative and <unk> care costs
<unk> <unk> chairman of the panel <unk> that administrative costs of utilization management programs can be high
you have a whole staff standing ready to <unk> the <unk> of recommended treatment he said
dr. <unk> who also is president of new england medical center hospitals in boston noted that the hospitals he runs deal with more than N utilization management firms and that many of them have different procedures and requirements
the panel urged greater efforts to reduce the <unk> <unk> and cost of utilization review
utilization management needs to better <unk> that it reduces the <unk> use of resources <unk> the <unk> of <unk> care and <unk> only reasonable <unk> on patients and <unk> the panel concluded
renault and <unk> trucks <unk> announced a preliminary agreement to jointly <unk> a line of trucks in britain and france
<unk> <unk> a renault managing director said the new line will cover trucks of between N tons and N tons and will be built at renault 's <unk> plant in france and at <unk> 's british plant
the french <unk> auto group and the dutch truck maker plan to <unk> the new trucks into their product lines when they begin production toward the middle of the 1990s
mr. <unk> said he expects a definitive agreement between the two companies to be completed in the next few months
the venture is the latest example of the trend toward <unk> projects in europe ahead of the N deadline for eliminating trade barriers within the european community
renault and <unk> are expected to invest a total of about three billion french francs $ N million in the venture including <unk> N billion for design and development costs
in addition the companies will each spend about <unk> N billion on <unk> up their plants
mr. <unk> said the joint venture represents considerable savings for both renault and <unk> since both companies would in any case have had to <unk> their existing ranges of light goods vehicles
by <unk> their resources the two groups have effectively <unk> the design and development costs that would otherwise have been <unk> he said
renault officials said the potential european market for light trucks in the <unk> to <unk> range is between N and N vehicles annually and renault and <unk> are <unk> for a combined market share of about N N
both renault and <unk> will have world-wide marketing rights for the new range of <unk> and light trucks
under a separate arrangement british aerospace plc 's <unk> group plc subsidiary will also be able to offer the vehicles through its dealers in the u.k. and renault 's <unk> subsidiary renault vehicles <unk> will have similar rights in france
<unk> is <unk> by british aerospace with a further N N held by the dutch <unk> chemical group <unk> <unk>

the federal reserve system is the standard <unk> of suggestions for <unk> and institutional changes for two reasons
first its position in the government is <unk>
it has an unusual kind of independence from elected officials and still has authority over one of the most powerful of government 's instruments the control of the money supply
thus we have a condition that is easily described as <unk>
second the <unk> of the federal reserve as <unk> of the currency which means as <unk> of the <unk> of the price level sometimes lead it to take measures that are <unk>
as former fed chairman william <unk> martin used to say they would have to take the <unk> <unk> away just as the party is getting interesting
so the federal reserve is an attractive target for complaint by politicians
the fed is easily assigned the blame for <unk> like high interest rates or slow economic growth while the politicians can escape responsibility by <unk> to the fed 's independence
this leads to proposals for reform of the fed which have the common <unk> of making the fed more <unk> to the administration to the congress and to public opinion without however any assumption of additional responsibility by the politicians
these proposals include changing the term of the chairman <unk> the terms of the members eliminating the <unk> of the federal reserve banks from the <unk> process putting the secretary of the treasury on the federal reserve board having the fed <unk> by an arm of congress the general accounting office putting the fed 's expenditures in the budget and requiring <unk> publication of the fed 's minutes
some of these ideas are again under consideration in congress
but these proposals do not rest on a view of what the fed 's problem is or if they do they rest on an <unk> view
they would not <unk> the problem they would make it worse
the problem is not that the fed is too <unk> to the public interest
on the <unk> it is too <unk> to an <unk> view of the public interest
the price level in the u.s. is now about N N times as high as it was N years ago
on average something that cost $ N N years ago now costs $ N
or a wage that was $ N N years ago would buy only $ N worth of stuff today
on two <unk> the inflation rate rose to more than N N a year
in each case the ending of this <unk> inflation caused a severe recession the two worst of the <unk> period
the enormous inflation over the past N years was largely due to monetary policy
at least it would not have happened without the support of monetary policy that provided for a <unk> increase in the money supply during the same period
and that increase in the money supply would not have happened without the consent of the federal reserve
the basic problem of monetary policy to which reform of the fed should be <unk> is to prevent a <unk> of this experience
there were two general reasons for the <unk> monetary policy of the past N years
N to some extent the federal reserve <unk> the popular but <unk> view that <unk> monetary policy could yield a net improvement in employment and output
N even where the fed did not share this view it felt the need to <unk> to it
despite all the formal provisions for its independence the fed seems <unk> to feel that if it uses its independence too <unk> it will lose it
the common proposals for <unk> the fed would only make the situation worse if they had any effect at all
putting the secretary of the treasury on the board of <unk> one of the leading proposals today is an example
the secretary is the world 's biggest <unk> of money
he has a <unk> <unk> <unk> for lower interest rates
moreover he is a political agent of a political president who naturally gives extraordinary weight to the way the economy will <unk> before the next election and less to its <unk> health
these days the secretary <unk> the further <unk> that he is a member of a club of seven finance ministers who meet occasionally to decide what exchange rates should be which is a <unk> from the real business of the federal reserve to <unk> the price level
how should a reasonable member of the federal reserve board <unk> a congressional decision to put the secretary on the board
could he <unk> <unk> it as <unk> for the fed to give primary <unk> to <unk> the price level
or would he <unk> it as <unk> to give more weight to these other objectives that the secretary represents low interest rates <unk> economic expansion and <unk> of exchange rates at <unk> managed levels
the answer seems <unk> clear
true a <unk> of fed <unk> has given color to the notion that the secretary of the treasury <unk> on the fed
by their <unk> <unk> to <unk> all and <unk> about federal <unk> matters the <unk> have encouraged the belief that fiscal policy and monetary policy are <unk> of a common <unk> in which case it is natural that the fed and the treasury and probably also the congress should be jointly engaged in <unk> the <unk>
the fed 's case for its own independence would be a little stronger if it were more <unk> of the independence of the rest of the government
the fed 's problem is not that it is too independent or too <unk>
the fed is <unk> to and can not help being <unk> to the more <unk> political part of the government
the fed <unk> a power given to it by congress and the president
but congress and the president accept no responsibility for the exercise of the power they have given the fed
critics of the present arrangement are correct to say that it is <unk>
what is <unk> is the <unk> of the more political parts of the government to take the responsibility for deciding the basic question of monetary policy which is what priority should be given to <unk> the price level
to leave this decision to an independent agency is not only <unk>
it also <unk> the conduct of a policy that has a long-term <unk> because it leaves the fed <unk> about what are the expectations of its <unk> the politicians who have never had to consider the long-term consequences of monetary policy
the greatest contribution congress could make at this time would be to <unk> that <unk> the price level is the primary responsibility of the federal reserve system
legislation to this effect has been introduced in congress in this session by rep. stephen <unk> d. <unk>
it is not the kind of thing that is likely to be enacted however
congress would be required to make a hard decision and congress would much prefer to leave the hard decision to the fed and retain its rights of complaint after the fact
people will say that the nation and the government have other objectives in addition to <unk> the price level which is true
but that is not the same as saying that the federal reserve has other objectives
the government has other agencies and instruments for pursuing these other objectives
but it has only the fed to pursue <unk> <unk>
and the fed has at most very limited ability to <unk> to the <unk> of other objectives by means other than by <unk> the price level
the two objectives most <unk> thought to be legitimate competitors for the attention of the fed are high employment and rapid real growth
but the main <unk> of economic policy in the past N years is that if the fed <unk> with the <unk> <unk> in the pursuit of these other goals the result is not high employment and rapid growth but is inflation

legislation to require the consent of parents before their <unk> under the age of N can have abortions will probably pass both houses of the michigan legislature and set up a <unk> battle to <unk> the expected veto of democratic gov. james <unk>
the short-term shift in the political climate surrounding abortion reflects two factors that are likely to <unk> the debate in the next several months the <unk> of the abortion-rights movement as a <unk> force after years of <unk> and the ability of each side to counter the other 's advance in one <unk> with a victory of its own elsewhere
the action in pennsylvania for example will follow last week 's collapse of a special session of the florida legislature to <unk> restrictions on abortions in that state and the vote here in washington by the house to permit federally paid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest
but president bush is expected to veto the congressional legislation and that along with the easy approval of the pennsylvania measure is likely to <unk> the abortion-rights activists ' claims of momentum and <unk> the challenges faced by this <unk> movement
it 's great to feel good for once in N years says <unk> <unk> a consultant to abortion-rights <unk> reflecting the relief of his <unk> after last week 's <unk> the first major events since the supreme court in its july N webster decision permitted the states to <unk> restrictions on abortions
but how many more times we 're going to feel good in the next N is another question
indeed abortion-rights activists still face their greatest tests
the pro-choice movement has shown finally that it can <unk> says <unk> <unk> a <unk> university political scientist who <unk> in how state legislators handle the abortion question
but it still has n't shown that it can win in a state like pennsylvania or missouri where abortion has been clearly an <unk> issue and where it 's been an emotional issue for a long time
the <unk> of abortion hold the strong <unk> hand in pennsylvania where abortion-rights activists are so much on the defensive that their strategy is less to fight the proposed legislation than it is to stress how the state legislature does n't reflect the <unk> of the state 's citizens
as a result gop state rep. stephen <unk> of delaware county the legislature 's leading <unk> of abortion has been given all but free <unk> to press a <unk> <unk> plan to restrict abortion and he hopes to force the supreme court directly to <unk> its N <unk> v. <unk> decision that established the right of abortion in the first place

but the pennsylvania measure also includes an informed consent provision that may become widely <unk> by abortion <unk> who want to make women <unk> abortion as <unk> as possible with the <unk> and with themselves
under this legislation a woman must be informed N hours before the operation of the details of the <unk> and its risks

in michigan where the state senate is expected to approve <unk> legislation by the end of next week gov. <unk> is the principal <unk> for <unk>
<unk> <unk> a consultant to abortion-rights activists in the state takes <unk> from the fact that the state 's house abortion opponents have n't been able to <unk> the votes to <unk> a veto on abortion in N years

b.a.t has been london 's <unk> blue chip over the past six months up N N against a N N rise in the financial times <unk> index
but this week b.a.t has been hit harder than other big u.k. stocks first by the market gyrations then by tuesday 's san francisco earthquake which could leave b.a.t 's farmers group inc. insurance unit facing big claims

proceeds will help pay for a planned buy-back of N N of its shares and a N N dividend increase
i think the restructuring will get the required support said michael <unk> an analyst at london <unk> <unk> phillips & drew
the shareholders effectively will support the share price by clearing the share buy-back
but b.a.t 's restructuring which was never going to happen quickly now will take longer because of the market <unk>
company officials holders and analysts who previously expected the <unk> to be substantially complete by the end of next year 's first half now say the market gyrations could delay the actions well into the second half
we are n't forced sellers
we do n't have an <unk> deadline and if market conditions are truly <unk> we might decide it is not the right time to take particular steps said michael <unk> a b.a.t spokesman
even if b.a.t receives approval for the restructuring the company will remain in play say shareholders and analysts though the situation may <unk> over the next N months rather than six
the new b.a.t will be a smaller tobacco and financial-services <unk> whose <unk> ratio may more closely reflect the <unk> tobacco business than the <unk> financial-services business these holders believe

b.a.t is n't predicting a <unk> because the units are quality businesses and we are encouraged by the <unk> of inquiries said mr. <unk>
but the delay could happen if b.a.t does n't get adequate bids he said
people familiar with b.a.t say possible <unk> for the units include managers from both retailing chains and general <unk> corp. which is interested in bidding for <unk>
other potential <unk> for parts of b.a.t 's u.s. retail unit include <unk> department stores inc. may department stores co. and limited inc

a <unk> <unk> <unk> computers inc. in <unk> calif. jumped into the <unk> earlier this week with an aggressively priced <unk>
ibm appears more worried about digital which has a broad base of customers waiting for the new line dubbed the <unk> N
it 's going to be nuclear war says thomas <unk> a consultant with <unk> group inc
the surge in competition is expected to <unk> new life into the huge mainframe market where growth has slowed to single <unk> in recent years
ibm 's traditional mainframe rivals including <unk> corp. control data corp. and <unk> corp. have <unk> recently
digital is promising a new approach
robert m. <unk> digital 's vice president for high performance systems says digital 's mainframe is designed not as a central computer around which everything <unk> but as part of a <unk> network <unk> together hundreds of <unk> personal computers <unk> and other devices
and unlike ibm 's <unk> mainframes it does n't need any <unk>
the <unk> will have a big price advantage
digital is expected to <unk> its new line from about $ N million to $ N million and up depending on <unk>
that 's about half the price of <unk> <unk> ibm mainframes

a key marketing target for digital will be the large number of big customers who already own both digital and ibm systems
one such company is bankers trust co
stanley rose a vice president <unk> and strategic planning at bankers trust says that despite digital 's low prices we are n't about to <unk> our ibm mainframes for a dec machine
the software <unk> costs would <unk> any savings
but mr. rose is still looking seriously at the N
bankers trust uses digital 's <unk> to run its huge <unk> and capital markets accounts <unk> hundreds of billions of dollars each day he says
as that system grows larger computers may be needed
in the past customers had to go to ibm when they <unk> the <unk>

digital 's new line has been a long time coming
the company has long <unk> to deliver a strong <unk> product and made a costly decision in N to halt development of an <unk> product meant to stem the revenue losses at the high end
digital 's failure to deliver a true <unk> machine before now may have cost the company as much as $ N billion in revenue in fiscal N mr. <unk> says

after failing to find a buyer for the sears tower in chicago sears <unk> & co. is negotiating with boston pension fund adviser <unk> <unk> & <unk> inc. to <unk> the property for close to $ N million according to people close to the negotiations
under the proposed agreement involving the world 's <unk> building chicago-based sears would receive about half the money through conventional mortgage financing and the other half as a convertible mortgage
at the end of the term of the convertible loan sears could still own half the building and <unk> could own the other half
neither side would comment
the parties are currently negotiating over who would manage the building which will be <unk> of N employees from sears ' merchandise group which is moving elsewhere
the new manager will face the <unk> task of leasing N million square feet in a relatively soft chicago real estate market
also it has not yet been decided exactly how much of the mortgage <unk> will be able to convert into equity
convertible mortgages have become an increasingly popular way to finance <unk> buildings of late
in a convertible mortgage the investor <unk> the building owner a certain amount in return for the option to convert its interest into equity usually less than N N at the end of the loan term
during the term the <unk> can either receive a percentage of cash flow a percentage of the building 's appreciation or a fixed return
the main advantage of a convertible mortgage is that it is not a sale and therefore does not <unk> costly transfer taxes and <unk>
sears said it would put the <unk> tower on the block almost a year ago as part of its <unk> restructuring
but japanese institutions <unk> away from bidding on the <unk> tower out of fear their purchase of the property would <unk> <unk> sentiment
last summer sears appeared to have a deal with canadian developer <unk> & york developments ltd
but that deal fell through in september after it became clear that the sale would lead to a major real estate tax <unk> raising property taxes and making it difficult to lease the building at competitive prices
real estate industry executives said sears ' investment banker goldman sachs & co. sought financing in japan
however japanese authorities apparently were concerned that a refinancing also would attract too much publicity
sears then went back to <unk> the boston pension adviser that had proposed a convertible debt deal during the first round of bids last spring
<unk> has $ N billion of real estate investments nationwide according to a spokesman
tandy corp. said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire two units of <unk> ab of stockholm for cash
the amount was n't disclosed
the electronics maker and retailer previously estimated the sale price at between $ N million and $ N million for <unk> 's <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> computer subsidiaries
in addition tandy will acquire rights to the <unk> and <unk> names for computers
during N the <unk> subsidiaries had combined sales in excess of $ N million
the transaction will give tandy a well-known european computer brand that includes N dealers and <unk> marketing to <unk> business and educational institutions
closing of the transaction is subject to certain conditions and regulatory <unk> the company said
two rules in pending congressional legislation <unk> to <unk> leveraged buy-outs by raising the price <unk> of such deals by as much as N N
wall street is <unk> over the rules which would <unk> the tax <unk> of debt used in most <unk>
the provisions in deficit-reduction bills recently passed by the house and senate could further cool the takeover <unk> that has been the driving force behind the <unk> market in stocks for much of the 1980s some tax experts and investment bankers argue
indeed some investment bankers have already started restructuring deals to <unk> with the expected rules
wall street has all but conceded on the issue and is now lobbying for the less <unk> senate version of one of the provisions
at issue is the <unk> of certain junk bonds that are used in most <unk>
such high-yield debt is similar to a zero-coupon bond in that it is sold at a discount to face value with interest <unk> instead of being paid to the holder
under current rules that <unk> interest is <unk> by the company <unk> the debt
the house version of the legislation would kill that deduction and <unk> any such debt as equity which is n't <unk>
the <unk> senate version would <unk> the <unk> for roughly five years
you see these in just about every lbo said robert <unk> senior vice president in charge of tax issues at shearson lehman hutton inc. in new york
it becomes a source of cash for the company making the lbo because it gets a deduction and does n't have to <unk> the debt for several years
typically mr. <unk> estimates this type of debt makes up N N to N N of the financing for <unk>
these types of bonds have been used in buy-outs of companies such as rjr nabisco inc. <unk> communications inc. and <unk> co
a second provision passed by the senate and house would eliminate a rule allowing companies that post losses resulting from lbo debt to receive <unk> of taxes paid over the previous three years
for example if a company posted a loss of $ N million from buy-out interest payments the existing rule would allow the concern to be able to receive a <unk> from the tax it paid from N through N when it may have been a profitable public company
but that rule is being virtually <unk> by wall street which is <unk> on <unk> with the deduction issue
prices for <unk> have to come down if you do n't have that <unk> argued lawrence <unk> managing director for merchant banking at donaldson lufkin & jenrette securities corp. in new york
several wall street officials say the proposed legislation already is having an impact
an investment group led by chicago 's <unk> family recently lowered a $ N billion bid for american medical international <unk> hills calif. because of the threat of the legislation
moreover one investment banker who requested <unk> said his firm did n't raise the <unk> for a target company earlier this month after a stronger bid emerged from a public company that was n't concerned about the financing provision
we would have paid more if we thought that law was n't going to pass he said
one possible solution for wall street is to increase the equity part of the transaction that is give lenders a bigger stake in the <unk> company rather than just interest payments
that would force the buy-out firm and the target company 's management to reduce their level of ownership
the <unk> in the <unk> may have to give a little bit of the <unk> back and then the deal can go through said peter c. <unk> tax partner at <unk> <unk> rosen & katz
another solution said a tax lawyer who requested <unk> is for firms to use convertible bonds that sell at a discount
since they have a lower interest rate they would n't fall under the junk-bond category that would lose its <unk>
the house version of the bill would make debt <unk> if it pays five percentage points above treasury notes has at least a five-year maturity and does n't pay interest for at least one year out of the first five
the bill would then <unk> that the debt is equity and therefore is n't <unk>
the senate bill would only deny the deduction until interest is actually paid
currently even though the <unk> does n't pay tax the debt holder is <unk> on the <unk> interest
but those holders are often foreign investors and <unk> pension funds that do n't pay taxes on their holdings
the senate estimates that its version of the provision would yield $ N million the first year and a total of $ N million over five years
the house version would raise slightly more
even if wall street finds ways around the new rules a senate aide contends <unk> will become somewhat more difficult
there 's no question it will make <unk> more expensive he said
the interest deduction was the engine that made these things more <unk>
the average publicly offered commodity fund fell N N in september largely because of the volatile markets in foreign currencies according to <unk> securities

but the pool of federal <unk> funds already is running low because of the heavy costs of <unk> up hurricane hugo and congress will be under pressure to <unk> more money quickly
in hugo 's wake congress <unk> $ N billion in relief funds and white house spokesman <unk> fitzwater said $ N million of that money remains and could be <unk> for quick expenditures related to the earthquake
now though enormous costs for earthquake relief will <unk> on top of outstanding costs for hurricane relief
that obviously means that we wo n't have enough for all of the <unk> that are now facing us and we will have to consider appropriate <unk> for <unk> funding mr. fitzwater said
the federal government is n't even attempting yet to estimate how much the earthquake will cost it
but mr. fitzwater said there will be i think quite obviously a very large amount of money required from all levels of government
in congress lawmakers already are looking for ways to add relief funds
money could be added to a pending spending bill covering the federal emergency management agency which <unk> federal disaster relief
more likely relief funds could be added to an <unk> spending bill that congress is to begin considering next week
but it is n't just washington 's relief dollars that are spread thin its relief <unk> also is <unk>
fema still has special disaster centers open to handle the aftermath of hugo and spokesman <unk> <unk> acknowledged that we 're pretty thin
mr. <unk> says fema now possibly may have the <unk> <unk> in its history
to further <unk> relief efforts the privately funded american red cross also finds itself <unk> for funds after its big hugo operation

all the <unk> types of federal aid that will be sent to california wo n't be determined until state officials make specific <unk> to fema agency officials said

still some aid is moving <unk> from washington almost immediately
hud officials said they will make available as many as N bay area houses that are under hud loans but now are <unk> after the houses have been <unk> to ensure they are sound
additional housing <unk> and certificates will be made available officials said and some housing and <unk> funds may be <unk> from other programs or made available for emergency use
another federal agency not normally associated with disaster relief the internal revenue service moved quickly as well
the irs said it will <unk> certain tax penalties for earthquake victims unable to meet return <unk> or make payments because of the quake 's <unk>
the agency plans to announce specific relief procedures in the coming days
and the treasury said residents of the san francisco area will be able to cash in savings bonds even if they have n't held them for the minimum six-month period
one advantage that federal officials have in handling earthquake relief is the large number of military facilities in the san francisco bay area facilities that provide a ready base of supplies and workers
even before the full extent of the <unk> was known defense secretary <unk> <unk> ordered the military services to set up an emergency <unk> center in the pentagon and prepare to respond to various fema <unk> for assistance

to help residents in northern california <unk> fema intends to set up N disaster assistance offices in the earthquake area in the next several days and to staff them with N to N workers from various agencies said robert <unk> chief of the agency 's individual assistance division
at these offices earthquake victims will be helped in <unk> out a <unk> form that they will need to qualify for such federal assistance as <unk> loans and to repair houses
and federal officials are promising to move rapidly with federal highway aid to <unk> the area 's <unk> damaged road system
the federal highway administration has an emergency relief program to help states and local governments repair federally funded highways and bridges seriously damaged by natural disasters
the account currently has $ N million
and though federal law <unk> that only $ N million can be <unk> from that fund in any one state per disaster administration officials expect congress to move in to <unk> spending more now in california
to get that money states must go through an elaborate approval process but officials expect red tape to be cut this time
<unk> <unk> special assistant to federal highway <unk> thomas <unk> also said that after the N san <unk> earthquake in southern california the state set tougher standards for bridges and with federal aid began a program to <unk> highways and bridges for earthquake <unk>

but for companies that use hundreds of eggs a day breaking them by hand can get well out of hand
the idea behind the egg king is pretty simple put the eggs into a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> spin them at a high speed to break the <unk> and strain the <unk> part through the <unk>
one egg king which at just under four feet <unk> and two feet wide has been <unk> to the <unk> <unk> can crack about N eggs an hour
because fresh eggs are less expensive than <unk> ones a big egg user can recover the egg king 's $ N cost in a few months says mr. maynard
such <unk> egg <unk> have been around since the <unk>
but when mr. maynard came forward with his machine in the early 1970s nobody else was offering them in the u.s.
the main reason <unk>
<unk> carry this <unk> which can cause <unk> <unk> and in <unk> cases death among people
<unk> sometimes pass <unk> to the eggs and it can also be found on <unk> <unk>
thus any machine that <unk> large amounts of eggs at once has the potential to spread <unk> if a bad egg gets in with the good ones
mr. maynard claims this is a <unk> problem
the egg king carries written instructions to break only high-grade eggs that have been <unk> <unk> and as an added <unk> to use the eggs only in products that will be <unk> enough to kill <unk>
with nearly N machines in use there have been no <unk> problems as long as instructions were followed mr. maynard <unk>
he says the handful of <unk> cases involving products that may have used eggs broken by an egg king <unk> from a failure to <unk> <unk> the products
but he says that 's no more a reason for <unk> egg <unk> than bad drivers are a reason for <unk> cars
opponents do n't buy such <unk>
human nature being what it is people do n't always follow instructions says jack <unk> chief of food protection for the new york state health department
leading the <unk> against the egg king has been united egg producers
the <unk> <unk> trade group has issued a <unk> book that claims the machine is a health <unk> and that mr. maynard is trying to make a fast <unk> at the expense of the nation 's egg producers
the <unk> declines to comment but the group 's attorney <unk> <unk> says the group 's actions are <unk> <unk> by health concerns
an early <unk> was the u.s. department of agriculture
mr. maynard initially won approval for his machine to be used at <unk> facilities <unk> by the <unk> 's food safety <unk> service
unfortunately for mr. maynard another branch of the <unk> the <unk> marketing service was in charge of eggs
after <unk> complaints from egg producers this branch got the other branch to <unk> its approval thus <unk> the machine 's potential market to <unk> and restaurants and other <unk> that are n't <unk> by the <unk>
the egg producers also <unk> the food and drug administration
but the fda in a N letter to the united egg producers said that there was little <unk> of a health problem as long as instructions were followed
so the producers went to capitol hill where a congressman from georgia introduced a measure to ban <unk> <unk> machines
mr. maynard whose company at the time was based in santa <unk> calif. <unk> his local congressman and the battle was joined
mr. maynard 's forces finally <unk> the measure though it took a vote on the floor of the house of representatives to do it
even then opponents managed to get a congressional hearing to <unk> what one congressman called an <unk> method for breaking eggs
<unk> in their effort to get a national ban the egg producers turned their attention to the states
so far new york new jersey <unk> georgia michigan and minnesota have <unk> mr. maynard 's device citing health concerns
an antitrust suit that mr. maynard 's company filed in los angeles federal court against the united egg producers and others only added to the entrepreneur 's <unk>
the judge dismissed the suit and ordered mr. maynard 's company to pay over $ N in legal fees to the defendants ' lawyers
mr. maynard says the ruling pushed his company into bankruptcy court
now he has moved to <unk> where costs are lower and started a new company <unk> inc. to market his machine
but so far the change of <unk> has n't ended his string of bad <unk>
mr. maynard recently fell from a horse and <unk> his arm
<unk> <unk> ca n't <unk> <unk> and <unk> at the same time
but on the evidence of the <unk> baker <unk> that may be the only thing she ca n't do at least when she 's acting in movies
as the tough <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> baker <unk> ms. <unk> <unk> for <unk> and more than <unk> well
her <unk> diamond <unk> a <unk> the way the <unk> do like she 's hearing the way it should sound inside her head and she 's <unk> on matching that internal tone
yet her <unk> <unk> and starts with the music
when she is n't <unk> for an audience she <unk> for a <unk> by <unk> the <unk> of <unk> from her <unk> and indicates that she 's finished by <unk> the <unk> back in
like almost everything in this <unk> <unk> and <unk> movie ms. <unk> 's <unk> seems like someone you 've seen before in numerous <unk> stories even her name <unk> diamond sounds like a character <unk> <unk> must have played
yet nothing about baker <unk> and certainly nothing about ms. <unk> really is like something from the video <unk>
steve <unk> the young writer and director he is n't yet N has only one produced picture to his credit he wrote the <unk> for <unk> with the <unk> a <unk> <unk> picture set in the <unk>
both movies are <unk> with the <unk> <unk> of someone much older someone who does n't <unk> <unk> but who also has enough experience to see his limits
however mr. <unk> <unk> his own material without <unk> and at its own <unk> pace baker <unk> is both <unk> and <unk>
he 's put a fresh spin on material that could come off <unk> <unk> for example the way <unk> <unk> an audience the first time she <unk> with the baker <unk>
of course it does n't hurt that mr. <unk> has made up for his lack of experience behind the <unk> with <unk> who know exactly what they 're doing
much of the picture 's <unk> <unk> from <unk> michael <unk> 's <unk> <unk> <unk> work
after working for years with <unk> <unk> <unk> the late german director and more recently with martin <unk> after hours the color of money the last <unk> of <unk> mr. <unk> has developed a <unk> <unk> style
and <unk> <unk> 's <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> requirements of <unk> <unk> <unk> is a must without <unk>
though ms. <unk> has the <unk> part she gets the best <unk> <unk> and to wear <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> the <unk> are pretty great too
what seemed like a good idea to cast the bridges brothers jeff and <unk> as the baker brothers actually turned out to be a good idea
anyone who 's tried to appear natural in front of a <unk> knows that it 's much more natural to end up looking like a <unk>
so it 's quite possible that the <unk> play between the brothers is n't natural at all that jeff and <unk> had to work like <unk> to make their <unk> love and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> seem so very real
when the movie <unk> the baker brothers are doing what they 've done for N years <unk> and twice as long as that for themselves they 're playing <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk>
they 're small time in the small <unk> not the best ones and restaurants in <unk>
yet they do n't <unk> their <unk> by <unk> their act
they wear <unk> most <unk> unless circumstances a regular <unk> at a <unk> <unk> for example require them to wear special <unk> like <unk> <unk>

whose della femina <unk> wcrs agency created <unk> <unk> <unk> among others announced a massive restructuring that largely <unk> it from the advertising business and includes selling the majority of its advertising unit to <unk> eurocom
the complex restructuring which was long expected <unk> <unk> wcrs from primarily a <unk> of advertising into one of europe 's largest buyers of advertising time and space
it also <unk> a newly merged world-wide ad agency controlled by eurocom and headed jointly by new york ad man jerry della femina and two top wcrs executives
the merged agency 's <unk> ambitious goal to become one of the world 's N largest agencies while <unk> more <unk> clients than the agencies were able to attract alone
wcrs 's restructuring reflects the growing importance of media buying in europe where the only way to get a good price on advertising time and space is to buy it in bulk
for eurocom meanwhile the move gives it a strong u.s. <unk> in della femina and more than <unk> the size of its ad agency business world-wide
it also gives the <unk> mr. della femina who often <unk> as much publicity for himself as for his clients an international <unk> that he most certainly wo n't be <unk> to use
according to terms wcrs will pay N billion french francs $ N million for the N N it does n't already own of carat holding s.a. one of europe 's largest media buyers
meanwhile eurocom which had held N N of wcrs 's ad unit will pay # N million $ N million to raise its stake to N N
that price also covers eurocom raising to N N its N N stake in europe 's <unk> group a joint venture ad agency network it owns with wcrs
eurocom will also have the right to buy the remaining N N of the merged ad agency group in six years
the transaction places the three executives <unk> at the <unk> of a major agency with the rather <unk> name of eurocom wcrs della femina ball ltd. or <unk>
the merged agency will include della femina <unk> based in new york eurocom 's various agencies in france the <unk> group in europe and wcrs 's other advertising and direct marketing operations
mr. della femina will be joint chairman with former wcrs executive <unk> <unk>
both will report to <unk> <unk> a former wcrs executive who will be chief executive officer at the new agency
in an interview in new york mr. <unk> fresh from a <unk> flight from paris where executives had worked through most of the night <unk> big plans for the new agency
our goal is to develop quite rapidly to a <unk> position by the end of three years from now
it <unk> very dramatic growth he said
he added that eurocom and wcrs had agreed to provide a development fund of # N million for acquisitions
the new agency group is already in discussions about a possible purchase in spain while mr. <unk> said it also plans to make acquisitions in <unk> germany and elsewhere
<unk> the top N within three years will be difficult at best
della femina had <unk> of just $ N million last year and <unk> as the u.s. 's <unk> ad agency
the merged company that it now becomes part of will have <unk> of just more than $ N billion most of that in europe bringing it to about <unk> world-wide
to make it to <unk> status it would have to <unk> over such <unk> forces as <unk> advertising <unk> <unk> <unk> & <unk> and <unk> 's <unk> <unk>
the merged agency 's game plan to attract <unk> <unk> advertisers may prove <unk> difficult
when wcrs created della femina <unk> out of the merger of three smaller agency units in N it said it did so in order to attract larger clients especially <unk> companies
since then della femina won pan am as an international client and also does work for a few <unk> clients including dow chemical co. 's <unk> <unk>
but major <unk> players of the world such as procter & gamble <unk> and <unk> have <unk> <unk> the agency
three of our favorite names mr. della femina calls that <unk> adding <unk> we 're a much more attractive agency to large <unk> today than we were yesterday
still the restructuring could create one of the most powerful <unk> between advertising and <unk> firms that europe has seen
as part of the restructuring wcrs and eurocom said they will look for ways to <unk> their media buying across europe
what 's more both eurocom and brothers <unk> and <unk> gross who founded carat will acquire N N stakes in wcrs group creating a powerful link between eurocom and carat
carat will receive its wcrs stake as part of payment for the N N carat stake that wcrs is buying while eurocom said it expects to pay about # N million for its wcrs stake
mr. della femina says he plans to remain heavily involved in the creative product at the world-wide agency serving as a sort of creative <unk>
<unk> <unk> della femina 's president will continue running the u.s. agency <unk>
they and other top executives signed long-term employment contracts and mr. della femina will receive an additional <unk> sum which some industry executives <unk> at about $ N million
wcrs group for its part will now be able to follow its <unk> plan of becoming a holding company for a series of <unk> businesses said peter scott the firm 's chief executive
in addition to carat wcrs will hold onto its public relations tv programming and other businesses
wcrs says its debt will be cut to # N million from # N million as a result of the transaction
for carat meanwhile the alliance with eurocom and wcrs is intended to <unk> its own push outside france
carat 's gross brothers <unk> the idea of <unk> buying of media space
by buying the space in bulk they obtain <unk> as high as N N which they can pass on to customers
they thus have won the french <unk> business of such advertising giants as coca-cola co. fiat <unk> a. <unk> and kodak
but now other agencies are getting into the business with their own competing <unk> groups and carat wants to expand to the rest of europe
to help finance the carat purchase wcrs said it plans an issue of <unk> preferred shares once the market <unk> down
but wcrs added that in the light of the current uncertainty in the equity markets it has arranged <unk> debt financing which would be <unk> by samuel <unk> & co. ltd

there can be no <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> suffering but one has to wonder what possible good such a resolution will <unk>
it puts great strain on a <unk> u.s. <unk> with turkey a country that has been one of america 's strongest allies in <unk>
the resolution also comes at a time when turkey has been seeking help from the united states in <unk> its <unk> <unk> controversy and pursuing democratic reforms that may lead to membership in the european community
turkey has been fighting its past for years and thus far has been only <unk> successful
must it now accept that one of its strongest allies <unk> it for the <unk> of another people
such sentiment only <unk> the <unk> <unk> toward turkey that <unk> when turkey asked for assistance in dealing with its <unk> <unk> crisis
mr. <unk> 's <unk> effort <unk> most of turkey 's political problems <unk> with the <unk>
part of the problem some <unk> have with turkey seems to stem from its location turkey is n't really part of europe
why they wonder should it <unk> to the <unk>
another <unk> <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of the majority of the <unk> people turkey we are told is not a christian nation its people simply wo n't fit in with the western european <unk> <unk>
it 's when these <unk> fall on <unk> <unk> that the old <unk> of <unk> for treatment at the hands of the <unk> empire comes to the <unk>
no one has to accept the <unk> of the <unk> empire to <unk> that argument
turkey in any event is long past it
the country has in recent years accepted more than N <unk> from at least four <unk> nations
<unk> suffering what many people consider to be a current <unk> campaign at the hands of <unk> iran and <unk> have <unk> eastern turkey
now it is their fellow <unk> <unk> as <unk> from <unk>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> crisis can not be ignored and <unk> off to that <unk> <unk> of history that has become so <unk> recently
<unk> the past suffering of any people at any time can not be simply filed away and <unk>
but what the senate <unk> committee has done in supporting the strongly <unk> <unk> resolution <unk> no <unk> end it merely produces more controversy and <unk> memories
congress has enough difficulty dealing with the <unk> of the world as it currently <unk>

many in washington say president bush will have to raise taxes to pay for his war on drugs
we have a better idea <unk> hud to pay for the war on drugs
housing and urban development 's budget is $ N billion
from what we and the nation have been reading the money is n't being spent very well
the single most important contribution the government could make now to help the poor is to get the specter of drugs out of their <unk>
if that takes money take it away from this <unk> federal department
but of course the democrats <unk> hud in hearings and in the press have no such solution in mind
instead they 're <unk> to protect the very programs at the heart of the hud scandal
this month hud secretary jack kemp unveiled a series of proposed reforms to improve management at hud
no doubt many of his ideas are <unk> but ultimately he is <unk> to make <unk> <unk> programs work slightly more fairly and <unk>
congress is unlikely to go even that far
last week secretary kemp ran into a <unk> of criticism from house banking committee members
they were <unk> for instance that he wanted to target more of the $ N billion community development block grant <unk> program to <unk> projects and <unk> out the <unk> <unk> funds that have allowed hud officials to <unk> contracts to political <unk>
these development grants mainly <unk> developers who want to put up shopping centers and parking <unk>
they also give those in congress political credit for bringing home the <unk> and so they are popular with such members as mary rose <unk>
rep. <unk> a democrat from cleveland wants a $ N million grant so cleveland can build an <unk> rock and roll hall of <unk>
she says it 'd create N jobs and bring cleveland tourist revenue
hud says the project does n't qualify and mr. kemp says that rock <unk> roll <unk> and the music industry ought to put up the money
at the hearing rep. <unk> started <unk> about <unk> <unk> regulations that would stand between her and housing for downtown cleveland
rep. <unk> <unk> an ohio republican rallied to the cause i think the <unk> is making an important statement
the <unk> that if a congressman calls about a project in his district there 's something wrong i think is most <unk>
we 're sure some <unk> can explain the difference between what the republican consultants have been doing with hud and what these <unk> and <unk> want to do with hud
our view is that given congress 's attitude toward hud the place probably is beyond reform
for more than N years the federal government has tried various ways to provide housing for the poor and revive cities
in the process hud has <unk> <unk> billions created <unk> and <unk> <unk>
much of hud 's spending actually is <unk> <unk> for developers or the middle class
that includes the <unk> funds and the federal housing administration which loans out money for private home mortgages and has just been discovered to be $ N billion in the <unk>

that same <unk> saw profit rates fall to N N in the recession year N and the supposed <unk> that followed has seen the profit rate rise only to N N in N and N N in N
<unk> to the fall in profit rates was in the early 1980s the drop in the number arrived at if you <unk> the market value of firms by the replacement costs of their assets the famous <unk> ratio associated with <unk> james <unk>
in theory the value attached to a firm by the market and the cost of <unk> its assets should be the same
but of course the market could decide that the firm 's capital stock its assets means nothing if the firm is not producing profits
this is indeed what the market decided
by N the ratio was N N meaning that the market was <unk> every dollar 's worth of the average firm 's assets at N cents
from the history of <unk> we can take it as a sound bet that if it takes only N cents to buy a dollar 's worth of a firm 's capital stock an <unk> entrepreneur wo n't look the other way
his assumption is that the underlying profitability rate will go up and the capital assets he bought on the cheap will soon be producing profits thus <unk> the market 's <unk> in them

the action follows federal express corp. 's acquisition of flying tiger line inc. in august
after that it would make sense for airlines to talk about doing things jointly said <unk> daly director of cargo services for new york consulting firm <unk> <unk> & <unk> inc
mr. daly said such discussions are <unk> by the competitive threat <unk> by federal express united <unk> service of america inc. and other <unk> air-freight companies
many airlines are talking about cargo ventures and there have been rumors about such a <unk> between <unk> and european airlines
in tokyo a <unk> spokesman said he could n't <unk> or deny the latest japanese report

nothing is defined or signed at this point mr. daly said of the talks
whatever accord the three carriers reach he said he is skeptical it would create a separate airline
if the three companies pool their air-freight businesses their <unk> would be considerable
according to figures from the international air transport association they carried a combined N million tons of freight last year
federal express and flying tiger as separate companies carried a combined N million tons
air france and lufthansa last month concluded a <unk> cooperation accord that includes air-freight activities
they plan to increase cooperation in freight <unk> and create a world-wide computer system to process cargo

in a move to prevent any <unk> in the financial markets from the california earthquake the securities and exchange commission said it temporarily <unk> options listed on the pacific stock exchange to the american new york and philadelphia stock exchanges and to the chicago board options exchange
the decision which <unk> millions of dollars of trading positions was made late yesterday because the pacific exchange 's options floor was shut down as a result of tuesday 's earthquake
the sec faced with a major squeeze on options positions said it was necessary to ensure that options listed on the exchange could be traded today and tomorrow

in addition specialists on the exchanges agreed to provide <unk> capital for <unk> in pacific exchange options traded on the exchanges
trading was light on the pacific stock exchange yesterday with workers at the exchange 's main floor in san francisco struggling to <unk> orders by <unk> as a result of a continuing power <unk>
the most <unk> problem was the suspension of options trading
the pacific exchange has options for N underlying stock issues including highly active <unk> hotels corp. which is listed on the big board
investors were concerned that they might be unable to exercise options that expire tomorrow
but professionals said throughout the day that the <unk> would n't be a cause for <unk> even if it were to <unk> for several days
i 've told my staff and clients that they still have the ability to exercise their options because they are guaranteed by the options clearing corp. said michael schwartz a senior registered options strategist at oppenheimer & co

also most of the telecommunications equipment was out
the traders were <unk> municipal bond mutual fund and other orders through a <unk> firm <unk> <unk> inc. which is also owned by john <unk> freedom securities but is based in new york
we are having a regular day
volume is down out of san francisco but not out of the N <unk> offices mr. <unk> added

at kidder peabody & co. 's sacramento branch manager <unk> white received calls yesterday morning from workers in san francisco who offered to work in sacramento
then she discovered that <unk> systems inc. 's sacramento lines were down because they are normally tied in through a system that goes through san francisco

international business machines corp. said its board approved the purchase of $ N billion of its common shares a move that should help support its battered stock
even as the stock market has generally done well this year ibm 's shares have slipped steadily from its <unk> high of $ N
yesterday 's closing price of $ N down N cents in composite trading on the new york stock exchange puts the stock at about N N times book value which is as low as it has <unk> over the past decade
the announcement came after the market 's close
the move by ibm was n't exactly a surprise
the company has spent some $ N billion over the past N N years to buy back N million common shares or roughly N N of those outstanding
in addition despite ibm 's <unk> recent problems the computer giant still <unk> enormous amounts of cash
as of the end of the second quarter it had $ N billion of cash and <unk> securities on hand
as a result some securities analysts had predicted in recent days that ibm would <unk> additional purchases
in <unk> n.y. a spokesman said that although ibm did n't view its spending as necessarily a way to support the stock it thought the purchases were a good way to improve such financial <unk> as per-share earnings and return on equity
we view it as a good long-term investment the spokesman said
in the short term the move is likely to have little effect
at yesterday 's closing price $ N billion would buy back about N million shares or less than N N of the roughly N million outstanding
in addition as of sept. N the company still had <unk> to buy $ N million of stock under a prior repurchase program
over the long term however ibm 's stock <unk> along with its hefty $ <unk> annual dividend and generally loyal following among large institutional investors are providing a floor for the stock price
although ibm last year produced its first strong results in four years and was expected to continue to roll this year it began <unk> as early as january
first it had trouble manufacturing a chip for its mainframes ibm 's <unk> business
then it had a series of smaller <unk> including problems manufacturing certain personal computers and the delay in the announcement of some important <unk>
finally ibm had to delay the <unk> of some <unk> disk drives which account for N N of its $ N billion of annual revenue
none of the problems is necessarily <unk> and they are n't all necessarily even related
there are also other factors at work that are outside ibm 's control such as currency exchange rates
the strong dollar which reduces the value of overseas earnings and revenue when they are translated into dollars is expected to <unk> N to N cents off ibm 's per-share earnings for the full year
without that problem ibm might have matched last year 's earnings of $ N billion or $ N a share
still investors will take some <unk> before they get back into ibm 's stock in a big way
steve <unk> a securities analyst at first boston said that while investors were looking for an <unk> to buy ibm shares a year ago even the big institutional investors are looking for a reason to avoid the stock these days

never mind that her husband <unk> <unk>
some weeks when her <unk> runs a <unk> promotion she <unk> that she <unk> $ N off her bill
money is n't the only thing that makes her <unk> once favorite brands
after she heard about the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> in many <unk> she dropped <unk> farm and started buying brands free of such <unk>
i always thought <unk> farm was <unk> and high quality mrs. <unk> says
but i do n't want any of that oil for my <unk>
<unk> farm says it ca n't tell exactly how many customers it has lost but it hopes to remove the <unk> <unk> oil from all its products by year end
clearly people like mrs. <unk> are giving <unk> <unk>
she represents a new <unk> of <unk> consumer who puts <unk> prices <unk> and environmental concerns and other <unk> ahead of <unk> brand loyalty
while brand loyalty is far from dead marketing experts say it has <unk> during the 1980s
<unk> themselves are partly to blame they 've increased spending for <unk> and other short-term promotions at the expense of <unk> advertising
what 's more a <unk> of new products has given consumers a <unk> choice of brands many of which are virtually <unk> <unk> of one other
<unk> have brought this on themselves with their heavy use of promotions contends <unk> <unk> an executive vice president at the <unk> <unk> <unk> & <unk> ad agency
without some real product improvements it 's going to be difficult to win that loyalty back
the wall street journal 's american way of buying survey this year found that most consumers <unk> brands for many of the products they use
for the survey peter d. <unk> research associates asked some N consumers including mrs. <unk> whether they usually buy one brand of a certain type of product or have no brand loyalty
more than half the users of N of the N products included in the survey said they 're brand <unk>
overall N N of consumers are n't brand loyal for any of the N product categories
about N N are loyal for one to five of the products
only N N are brand loyal in N to N of the categories and no one is loyal for more than N types of products
for such products as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to a single brand was quite low with fewer than N N saying they usually buy the same brand
only for cigarettes <unk> and <unk> did more than N N of users say they typically stick with the same brand
people tend to be most loyal to brands that have <unk> <unk> such as cigarettes and <unk>
<unk> <unk> a <unk> in the journal survey from <unk> <unk> says her husband is <unk> about <unk> only hunt 's <unk>
he simply ca n't <unk> the <unk> of <unk> she says
the <unk> <unk> adds the only other thing i 'm really loyal to is my virginia <unk> cigarettes
coke and <unk> are all the same to me and i usually buy <unk> brand of coffee <unk> to be on sale
brand <unk> plays a significant role in loyalty to such products as cigarettes <unk> and beer
people often stay with a particular brand because they want to be associated with the image its advertising <unk> whether that 's <unk> <unk> cigarettes or <unk> 's <unk> <unk>
loyalty <unk> most for <unk> products like <unk> <unk> and <unk>
only N N of <unk> users in the journal survey usually buy the same brand and just N N of <unk> buyers stick to one brand
<unk> <unk> a <unk> N N in brand loyalty but consumer researchers say that 's actually quite high for such a <unk> product
in the past you just <unk> fruit of the <unk> and did n't care says peter <unk> u.s. director of consumer behavior research for the j. walter thompson ad agency
the high <unk> reflects the attempts to make <unk> more of a fashion image business for both men and women
he believes there 's opportunity for a <unk> gasoline <unk> to create a strong brand image and more consumer loyalty
what loyalty there is to gas brands he believes is a matter of <unk> at the most <unk> located service stations
brand loyalty was stronger among older consumers in the journal survey
nearly <unk> of participants age N and older claim brand loyalty for more than N of the N products in the survey only N N of those age N to N have such strong <unk>
<unk> people also tend to be more brand loyal these days the journal survey and other research studies indicate
<unk> <unk> that more <unk> people tend to lead more <unk> lives and do n't have time to research the products they buy for the highest quality and most reasonable price
an established brand name is insurance that at least the product will be of <unk> quality if not always the best value for the money
it 's sort of loyalty by default
meanwhile the bottom end of the market is becoming less loyal says <unk> <unk> vice chairman of the ad agency <unk> katz partners
they 're buying whatever 's cheaper
the biggest wild <unk> in the brand loyalty game how those <unk> <unk> but highly <unk> baby <unk> will <unk> as they move into middle age
they grew up with more brand choices than any generation and have shown less <unk> so far
but now that they 're <unk> down and raising families might they also show more <unk> in their brand choices
mr. <unk> of j. walter thompson does n't think so
he believes baby <unk> will continue to be <unk> in their brand <unk>
earlier <unk> were brand loyal across categories he says but <unk> tend to be brand loyal in categories like running <unk> and <unk> water but less so in others like <unk> paper and <unk>
while not as brand loyal as in the past consumers today do n't buy products <unk> either
rather they tend to have a set of two or three <unk>
sometimes they 'll choose <unk> <unk> <unk> other times it will be <unk>
advertisers <unk> this <unk> loyalty to the striking <unk> among brands
if a more <unk> <unk> hits the market you can be sure a new and improved <unk> wo n't be far behind
the <unk> <unk> ad agency <unk> brand <unk> and found that consumers believe all brands are about the same in a number of categories particularly credit cards paper <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> chips
when there 's a <unk> of brands consumers <unk> the <unk> by telling themselves all brands are the same so what difference does it make which i buy says <unk> <unk> a senior vice president at <unk>
too often advertising <unk> has n't done a good job of <unk> a special emotional bond between a brand and the consumer
but given such strong brand <unk> some <unk> are putting renewed <unk> on image advertising
a small but growing number of companies are also trying to <unk> more <unk> brand loyalty through such <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> magazines and membership <unk> for brand users
while discount promotions are essential for most brands some companies <unk> they went <unk> in <unk> money from advertising to <unk> <unk> and other sales incentives
some people argue that strong brands can afford to stop advertising for a time because of the <unk> impact of hundreds of millions of dollars spent on advertising through the years
but most companies are too afraid to take that chance
and perhaps with good reason
says <unk> <unk> president of the <unk> <unk> ad agency 's u.s. division every time N hours pass without any advertising <unk> brand loyalty will <unk> ever so slightly even for a powerful brand like <unk>
consider for example what happened to maxwell house coffee
the kraft general foods brand stopped advertising for about a year in N and gave up several market share points and its leadership position in the coffee business
but since returning to advertising maxwell house has <unk> the lost share and is running <unk> and <unk> with <unk> <unk>
now philip morris kraft general foods ' parent company is committed to the coffee business and to increased advertising for maxwell house says <unk> <unk> president of the general foods <unk> division
even though brand loyalty is rather strong for coffee we need advertising to maintain and <unk> it
<unk> <unk> co. for one has concluded that it makes good sense to focus more on its most loyal customers than on people who buy competitive brands
the <unk> of <unk> a <unk> to your brand is about three in N says <unk> <unk> the company 's vice president for marketing research
the best odds are with your core franchise
our heavy users <unk> two to three <unk> of <unk> a week and we 'd like to increase that

insurers face the prospect of paying out billions of dollars for damages caused by this week 's california earthquake
getting a <unk> on the extent of the damages is <unk> a far more difficult task than what insurers faced after hurricane hugo <unk> through the <unk> and the <unk> last month
the earthquake 's toll including possible deep structural damage goes far beyond the more easily <unk> damage from a hurricane says george <unk> a vice president in <unk> life & casualty insurance co. 's claims division
but investors are <unk> that the financial and <unk> impact of the earthquake coming so soon after the hurricane will help stem more than two years of intense <unk> wars among business insurers
reflecting that <unk> <unk> stocks posted strong gains

about N <unk> were <unk> yesterday afternoon along with <unk> computers cellular <unk> and <unk> checks

state farm mutual automobile insurance co. the largest home and auto insurer in california believes the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than the $ N million in damages it expects to pay out for claims resulting from hurricane hugo
state farm based in <unk> <unk> is also the largest writer of <unk> earthquake insurance in california
earthquake insurance is sold as a separate policy or a specific <unk> <unk> on a <unk> 's policy in california because of the area 's <unk> to earthquakes

they expect to have a preliminary estimate of the damages in a day or two
roads and bridges in the bay area appear to have suffered some of the most costly damage
highways such as the section of interstate N that collapsed in oakland generally do n't have insurance coverage
industry officials say the bay bridge unlike some bridges has no earthquake coverage either so the cost of <unk> it probably would have to be paid out of state general operating funds
however the bridge which charges a $ N toll each way does have loss of income insurance to replace lost revenue if the operation of the bridge is <unk> for more than seven days
that coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance companies including fireman 's fund corp. based in <unk> calif. and <unk> corp. based in philadelphia
<unk> claims are n't expected to cause significant financial problems for the insurance industry as a whole
instead even with the liabilities of two natural disasters in recent weeks analysts said the total capital of the industry is likely to be higher at year end than it was at <unk>
indeed the earthquake could <unk> to a turnaround in the insurance cycle in a couple of ways
for example insurers may seek to limit their future exposure to <unk> by increasing the amount of reinsurance they buy
such increased demand for reinsurance along with the losses the <unk> will bear from these two disasters are likely to <unk> increases in reinsurance prices that will later be translated into an overall price rise
reinsurance is protection taken out by the insurance firms themselves
we are saying this is the breaking point this is the event that will change the psychology of the <unk> said william <unk> an analyst with <unk> & co. a <unk> firm that <unk> in the insurance industry
his firm along with some others issued new buy <unk> on insurer stocks yesterday
among the insurance stocks big <unk> included american international group up $ N to $ N general <unk> corp. up $ N to $ N <unk> up $ N to $ N and <unk> & <unk> inc. up $ N to $ N

british west german <unk> and other overseas insurers are <unk> for big claims from the san francisco earthquake disaster
although it 's <unk> how much exposure the london market will face u.k. traditionally have a large reinsurance exposure to u.s. <unk> coverage
jack <unk> chairman of fireman 's fund said this disaster will test the <unk> reinsurance market causing these rates to <unk>
the <unk> losses sustained by insurers this year will probably be the worst on an <unk> basis since N when another earthquake <unk> the great san francisco fire
<unk> <unk> an insurance consultant in new york estimates that the N san francisco <unk> on an <unk> basis included insured losses of $ N billion

sir john <unk> told reporters at london 's <unk> yesterday he would be <unk> if we could n't do the deal within a month
he said the <unk> would mean jaguar could develop cars down range in price from where we are by offering access to gm 's <unk> parts production
besides creating joint manufacturing ventures the accord is expected to give gm about a N N stake that eventually would rise to about N N
jaguar figures a friendly alliance with gm will fend off <unk> advances from ford motor co
but ford jaguar 's biggest shareholder since <unk> its stake to N N this week is <unk> harder for talks with sir john
we 're getting to the point where we are going to have to meet with him one ford official said yesterday
ford probably will <unk> its request for such a meeting soon he added
sir john has <unk> ford 's advances since the u.s. auto giant launched a surprise bid for as much as N N of jaguar last month
ford has <unk> it might acquire a majority interest later
i 'm not <unk> to sit down and talk to anybody the jaguar chairman asserted yesterday
he did n't rule out negotiations with ford however
the <unk> <unk> but financially <unk> british company <unk> to remain independent and publicly held despite ford 's promise of access to cash and <unk> <unk>
sir john noted that gm a longtime jaguar supplier <unk> we should remain an independent company
he said jaguar started negotiating with gm and several other car makers over a year ago but the rest dropped by the <unk> ever since the share price went above # N $ N a share
jaguar shares stood at N pence before ford 's initial announcement but the subsequent takeover <unk> has driven them up
the stock traded late yesterday on london 's stock exchange at N pence up N pence

it generally <unk> no more than # N $ N roughly # N less than the <unk> <unk> which are all known for their <unk> <unk> work
we have designs for such executive cars but have never been able to develop them sir john said
gm 's help would make it possible for jaguar to build a wider range of cars
an executive model would significantly boost jaguar 's <unk> output of N cars
you are talking about a couple hundred thousand a year said bob <unk> an <unk> analyst at u.k. brokerage james <unk> & co
a pact with gm may emerge in as little as two weeks according to sources close to the talks
the deal would require approval by a majority of jaguar shareholders
we have to make it attractive enough that holders would accept it sir john said
that may be difficult the jaguar chairman acknowledged when you have somebody else <unk> down your <unk>
ford probably would try to kill the proposal by <unk> support from u.s. <unk> speculators and holding out the <unk> of a larger bid later said stephen <unk> european auto analyst at london brokers <unk> phillips & drew
ford ca n't make a <unk> bid for jaguar until u.k. government restrictions expire
the <unk> measure <unk> any outside investor from buying more than N N of jaguar shares without permission until dec. N N
but with its N N stake ford can <unk> a special jaguar shareholders ' meeting and urge them to drop the restrictions <unk>
it 's a very valuable <unk> in their <unk> which could enable ford to bid <unk> for jaguar <unk> mr. <unk> of james <unk>
otherwise jaguar may have to <unk> the two u.s. auto giants each <unk> a N N stake for more than a year

the margin of error for <unk> for example married women with children at home would be larger
in addition in any survey there is always the chance that other factors such as question <unk> could introduce <unk> into the findings

they accounted for a hefty N N of new york stock exchange volume monday the fourth <unk> session ever
on friday N N of volume was in <unk> program trades

program traders were publicly <unk> following the <unk> crash oct. N N and a number of brokerage firms pulled back from using this strategy for a while
but as the <unk> <unk> by the spring of N they <unk>
some observers thought that after friday 's sharp drop the firms would <unk> in their program traders to avoid <unk> more controversy
but the statistics released yesterday show the firms did nothing of the sort
one reason they said was that the official reports on the N crash <unk> program trading as a cause
stock-index arbitrage is the most controversial form of program trading because it <unk> market moves if not actually causing them
in it traders buy or sell stocks and offset those positions in stock-index futures contracts to profit from <unk> price <unk>
under the exchange 's <unk> program trading also describes a number of other strategies that in the opinion of some traders do n't cause big swings in the market
the big board 's disclosure of program trading activity on these two days was unusual
though it <unk> such data daily its monthly reports on program trading usually come out about three weeks after each month ends
the september figures are due to be released this week
the big board declined to name the wall street firms involved in the activity friday and monday or the type of strategies used
but traders on the exchange floor who can <unk> the <unk> trading activity on monitor screens said most of the top <unk> firms were active both days
through august the top five program trading firms in volume were morgan stanley & co. kidder peabody & co. merrill lynch & co. painewebber group inc. and salomon brothers inc
though brokerage officials <unk> their use of program trading one sign of what an issue it remains was that few executives would comment on the record
besides <unk> the <unk> for program trading <unk> in the brady commission report they said stock-index arbitrage was actually needed monday to restore the markets ' <unk>
on friday the stock-index futures market was <unk> from the stock market when the chicago mercantile exchange halted trading in standard & poor 's N futures contract a circuit <unk> <unk> <unk> after the N crash and <unk> for the first time

the <unk> holding company for arizona 's largest bank said it added $ N million to its <unk> for losses on loans and for real estate owned
the company earned $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier
for the nine months valley national posted a net loss of $ N million or $ N a share
it had profit of $ N million or $ N a share in the N period
valley national had been paying a quarterly dividend of N cents a share
the arizona real estate market continues to be depressed and there is still uncertainty as to when values will recover james p. simmons chairman said
the decision to increase the loan-loss reserve and <unk> the dividend is both <unk> and in the best long-term interest of the shareholders he said
valley national said it made the decision on the basis of an overall assessment of the <unk> and the condition of its loan portfolio and after reviewing it with federal regulators
the addition to reserves comes on top of a provision of $ N million that was announced in june
in july moody 's <unk> $ N million of the company 's debt saying the bank holding company had n't taken adequate <unk> against potential losses on real estate loans despite its <unk> <unk>
richard m. <unk> valley national 's executive vice president said then that the company believed the <unk> were adequate and did n't plan to increase its reserves again
<unk> <unk> a banking analyst with <unk> & co. a denver brokerage firm said valley national is n't out of the <unk> yet
the key will be whether arizona real estate turns around or at least <unk> he said
they 've stepped up to the <unk> to take the <unk> but when markets head down a company is always <unk> to further negative <unk> mr. <unk> said
valley national closed yesterday at $ N a share down $ N in national over-the-counter trading
two years of <unk> down the <unk>
that 's the way a lot of brokers feel today on the second <unk> of the N stock-market crash
ever since that <unk> black monday they 've been <unk> <unk> wary individual investors trying to <unk> them that oct. N N was a <unk> and that the stock market really is a safe place for average americans to put their <unk> dollars
and until last friday it seemed those efforts were starting to pay off
some of those <unk> were coming back says <unk> quick jr. chairman of discount brokers quick & <unk> group inc
we had heard from people who had n't been active for a long time
then came the <unk> <unk> plunge in the dow jones industrial average and a new wave of stock-market volatility
all of a sudden it was back to square one
it 's going to set things back for a period because it <unk> the concern of volatility says jeffrey b. <unk> president of shearson lehman hutton inc
i think it will <unk> confidence one more time and a lot of this business is based on client confidence
brokers around the country say the reaction from individual investors this week has been almost <unk>
customers and potential customers are suddenly <unk> about the stock market in the <unk> way they did in <unk> N
the kinds of questions you had before have <unk> says raymond a. chip <unk> chairman of regional brokerage firm <unk> <unk> inc. baltimore
i can just tell the questions are right back where they were what 's going on ca n't anything be done about program trading does n't the exchange understand where is the sec on this
mr. <unk> says he 's convinced the public still wants to invest in common stocks even though they believe the <unk> is <unk> against them
but these wide swings <unk> them to death
all of this is bad news for the big brokerage firms such as shearson and merrill lynch & co. that have big retail or <unk> businesses
after expanding rapidly during the <unk> years up to the N crash retail brokerage operations these days are getting barely enough business to pay the <unk>
true the amount of money investors are willing to <unk> to their brokers has been growing <unk>
but those dollars have been going into such safe products as money market funds which do n't generate much in the way of commissions for the brokerage firms
at discount brokerage charles <unk> & co. such <unk> investments recently accounted for a record $ N billion of the firm 's $ N billion of client 's assets
the brokers ' hope has been that they could soon <unk> investors into <unk> some of their <unk> into the stock market
and before last friday they were actually making modest progress
a slightly higher percentage of new york stock exchange volume has been attributed to retail investors in recent months compared with <unk> N according to securities industry association data
in N an average N N of big board volume was retail business with the monthly level never more than N N
the retail participation dropped to an average N N in N and <unk> to barely N N some months during the year
yet in N retail participation has been more than N N in every month and was N N in august the latest month for which figures are available
jeffrey <unk> the <unk> 's research director says that all of his group 's <unk> statistics could be <unk> by as much as five percentage points because corporate <unk> are sometimes <unk> included in big board data
but there did seem to be a retail activity <unk>
but friday did n't help things says mr. <unk>
with the gyrations of recent days says hugo <unk> senior vice president at charles <unk> many small investors are <unk> convinced that they should n't play in the stock market
joseph <unk> president of retail sales and marketing at painewebber group inc. still thinks that individual investors will eventually go back into the stock market
investors will develop <unk> <unk> and their confidence will return he says
friday 's plunge he is telling painewebber brokers was nothing more than a tremendous reaction to leveraged buy-out stocks
meanwhile painewebber remains among the leaders in efforts to simply persuade investors to keep giving wall street their money
it 's more of an important issue to keep control of those assets rather than push the investor to move into specific products such as equities mr. <unk> says
the equity decision will come when the client is ready and when there 's a <unk> of confidence
it could be a long wait say some industry observers
some investors will <unk> back in says richard ross a market research director for <unk> & <unk> in chicago
then there 'll be another <unk>
given enough of these this will drive everyone out except the most <unk> he adds
mr. ross who has been studying retail investors ' <unk> of risks in the brokerage industry said a market plunge like friday 's <unk> investors ' confidence in their ability to make any <unk> on the market

senate republicans have settled on a proposal that would cut the capital-gains tax for individuals and corporations
at the same time a small group of senate democrats are working on a similar plan and may introduce it soon
sen. bob <unk> r. <unk> the lead <unk> of the gop proposal said he intends to <unk> the plan today and to offer it as an amendment to whatever legislation comes along particularly this month 's bill to raise the federal borrowing limit
he gave <unk> odds that a capital-gains tax cut of some sort would be approved this year though it probably wo n't be included in the pending deficit-reduction bill
he added that he expects to talk to the democrats who also wanted to cut the gains tax about <unk> a joint proposal
for individuals the <unk> plan would exclude from income N N of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year
the <unk> would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held until it reached a maximum of N N
the <unk> would apply to assets sold after oct. N N
as an alternative he said taxpayers could <unk> to reduce their gains by an inflation index
for corporations the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to N N from the current top rate of N N
that rate would <unk> decline to as little as N N for corporate assets held for N years
the <unk> plan would also include a proposal designed by sen. william <unk> r. <unk> that would expand and alter the deduction for individual retirement accounts
the <unk> plan would create a new <unk> <unk> from which money could be <unk> <unk> not only for retirement but also for the purchase of a first home and to pay education and medical expenses
current <unk> could be <unk> over into the new <unk> but would be subject to tax
for their part the group of democrats are working on a plan that like the <unk> proposal would grant larger <unk> to assets the longer they were held by individuals and companies
newly acquired assets would get a bigger break than those currently held
an extra <unk> would be given to <unk> stock in small and <unk> corporations just starting up
no one in the senate is considering the capital-gains plan passed by the house
that plan would provide a N N <unk> to assets sold over a N <unk> period ending dec. N N

of the <unk> of companies <unk> by this newspaper few reported any damage that they did n't expect to have <unk> within a day or two
it is possible of course that some of the most seriously damaged companies could n't be reached particularly in areas <unk> the epicenter
typical perhaps was the situation at new united motor manufacturing inc. the general motors <unk> <unk> auto plant in <unk> about N miles south of oakland
<unk> of the plant 's workers were injured when the quake hit about a <unk> into the afternoon shift seven were <unk>
metal <unk> on the plant floor fell over and water <unk> <unk> a spokeswoman says

most banks were closed but were expected to reopen today with few problems anticipated
at the federal reserve bank of san francisco vice president robert <unk> says operations were <unk> along as usual yesterday afternoon
when the quake hit we turned on our emergency <unk> and brought our computers up he says
the fed <unk> as a <unk> for banks taking checks from one bank and sending them to another an operation that it handled <unk> tuesday night after the quake
the volume we received from the banks was a lot lower than usual he says
a <unk> plan in which the los angeles fed would come to san francisco 's aid was n't needed he adds
most of the telephone problems in the immediate aftermath <unk> from <unk>
the telephone network simply could n't handle the large number of people seeking to make a call at the same time
the volume resulted in <unk> delays that were as short as N <unk> and as long as five minutes
mr. <unk> puts traffic volume at N to N times normal

william e. <unk> pacific bell 's vice president of customer services for the bay area says most long-distance companies were <unk> about N N of all calls
pacific telesis says its pacific bell unit also was <unk> about N N of its calls <unk>
<unk> the long-term effect of the earthquake may be to bolster the bay area 's economic <unk> and indeed the nation 's gross national product
it may also lead to new <unk> in major construction projects such as <unk> highways
it would in the <unk> give a boost to the san francisco economy because there will be an <unk> of people to help says <unk> burnham <unk> a regional economist at <unk> hill a <unk> mass. <unk> firm
the construction industry is sure to feel increased demand
there will be a big <unk> of federal dollars and gains in state federal and local employment ms. <unk> says
adds <unk> <unk> an economist at georgia state university there 's nothing positive about an earthquake but it will probably generate more construction activity
wall street reacted <unk> yesterday to the disaster by bidding up stocks of construction and related companies
shares of lone star industries inc. a <unk> maker rose sharply in anticipation of <unk> demand
in greenwich conn. lone star spokesman michael london says obviously with an earthquake of this size there are likely to be construction projects that would n't otherwise have been anticipated
but any increase is n't likely to be any kind of a surge
it 's something likely to be spread out over a long period of time
there will be a lot of repair work that wo n't require the quantities of <unk> or concrete that new <unk> would
lone star 's san francisco facilities were n't damaged in the quake
the earthquake is likely to reduce gnp <unk> in the near term and then could raise it a bit as <unk> begins
the first effects are of course negative as work is <unk> and people lose income and cut spending
corporate profits may also <unk> initially
many of the lost <unk> dollars wo n't be recovered many <unk> delayed never take place
subsequently however the ill effects are likely to be offset at least in economic terms as construction activity begins
because of the way the government <unk> its books the damage to the bay bridge however costly wo n't be <unk> as a <unk>
the money spent on repairs will be <unk> as a plus
it 's very difficult to model the long-term impact of this says <unk> goldberg who studies the <unk> and <unk> aspects of earthquakes at the center for strategic international studies in washington <unk>
you certainly can say it 's going to be extremely severe
we really are talking about <unk> down a major american city for a number of days maybe for a few weeks
mr. goldberg says the cost of the earthquake will <unk> top $ N billion and could reach $ N billion
he <unk> that early damage estimates are often low the damage <unk> in hurricane hugo increased <unk> as more information was received
the earthquake damage of course would have been far greater if the epicenter had been in downtown san francisco
a direct hit on a major city mr. goldberg figures would cause $ N billion to $ N billion of damage
experts caution that it is far too soon for <unk> estimates of the quake 's total damage but it 's clear that insurers are likely to pay out enormous <unk>
jack <unk> the chairman of fireman 's fund corp. which is based in <unk> calif. estimates insured losses resulting the earthquake could total $ N billion
the impact on the insurance industry will be big and <unk> but less than hurricane hugo says mr. <unk> who <unk> the bay area by car yesterday afternoon to get a sense of the company 's exposure to the earthquake
mr. <unk> says fireman 's fund will probably pay hundreds of millions in primary claims but after taxes and use of its reinsurance lines the company 's <unk> charge against earnings should n't top $ N million
the company was able to <unk> its damage liability quickly because it has <unk> <unk> of northern california showing the <unk> <unk> of all the property it <unk>
fireman 's fund had claims <unk> on the streets of san francisco right after <unk> yesterday and was paying as many claims as it could right on the spot
fireman 's fund <unk> N homes and <unk> and N businesses in the bay area
in addition to paying for earthquake and fire damage the insurer must cover <unk> claims and also losses due to businesses being shut down by lack of power or phone service
but many <unk> may not have adequate insurance coverage to pay for damages to their property
the independent insurance agents of america says fewer than one of every five california homeowners has earthquake insurance
a somewhat higher percentage of people living in the bay area have bought the additional insurance protection but the great majority are n't covered
earthquake insurance typically runs $ N or more a year for a small house

east germany yesterday <unk> <unk> honecker one of the <unk> <unk> against the reform <unk> through the communist world in an effort to win back the confidence of its increasingly <unk> citizens
but while it was a move that <unk> the east bloc it hardly <unk> in an era of reform at least <unk> soon
for the politburo replaced mr. honecker who had led east germany for N years and before that headed its security <unk> with a man cut of the same <unk> <unk> krenz the most recent <unk> chief and a longtime honecker <unk>
east germany it is clear is no poland where the communist party now shares power with the <unk> elected solidarity union
nor is it a hungary where yesterday the parliament approved constitutional changes meant to help turn the communist nation into a <unk> democracy
still any change in east germany has enormous implications for both east and west
it raises the <unk> hopes of many germans for <unk> a prospect that almost <unk> <unk> political leaders in moscow washington and western europe
mr. krenz N was named the new party chief just minutes after the party 's <unk> central committee <unk> in east berlin
although the east german news agency <unk> claimed mr. honecker had asked to be <unk> of his duties for health reasons west german government sources said the <unk> politburo had asked for his resignation at a separate meeting late tuesday
mr. honecker was twice <unk> this summer for a <unk> <unk> <unk> and his <unk> condition has been the subject of intense speculation in the western media
<unk> said mr. honecker a <unk> <unk> who in N <unk> the construction of the berlin wall also was <unk> of his title as head of state and his position as chief of the military
mr. krenz is expected to be formally named to all three positions once the nation 's parliament <unk> later this week
mr. honecker 's <unk> fall <unk> nearly two decades of <unk> leadership during which mr. honecker now N years old built east germany into the most <unk> advanced nation in the soviet bloc
his <unk> on power <unk> this summer as thousands of his <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of his rule <unk> to the west
thousands more have taken to the streets in the last month in east germany 's largest wave of domestic <unk> since a workers ' <unk> in N
in washington the bush administration took a <unk> cautious and skeptical view of the leadership change
the official line was to offer <unk> ties to mr. krenz provided he is willing to institute reforms
but u.s. officials have strong <unk> that he is a <unk>
president bush told reporters whether that the leadership change reflects a change in <unk> relations i do n't think so
because mr. krenz has been very much in accord with the policies of honecker
one top u.s. expert on east germany added there is no <unk> champion of reform that we know of in the east german leadership
indeed mr. krenz said on east german television last night that there will be no <unk> of power with <unk> groups
he said while <unk> is important enough <unk> already exist in which different interests can express themselves
the <unk> of mr. honecker was apparently the result of <unk> <unk> within the top <unk> of the communist party
according to west german government sources mr. honecker and several senior politburo members <unk> over the last week to delay any decisions about a leadership change
but with public <unk> in the country growing in size and <unk> mr. honecker and several key allies lost out in this battle officials say
those allies included politburo members <unk> <unk> who has long headed economic affairs and <unk> <unk> chief of information policy
both men were also <unk> of their duties yesterday
although other <unk> may follow it 's still not clear to what extent the change in party personnel will alter the government 's resistance to fundamental change
clearly the central figure in this process is <unk> krenz
born in N in a <unk> sea town now part of poland he was eight years old when world war ii ended
like west german chancellor <unk> <unk> he represents the <unk> generation that has grown up during germany 's division
since joining the politburo in N as its <unk> member mr. krenz had acquired the <unk> <unk> prince a <unk> to the widely held view that he was the <unk> successor to mr. honecker
in fact the two men have had <unk> similar career <unk> both having served as chief of internal security before their rise to the top party position
moreover both men have <unk> to a similar <unk> <unk>
<unk> one of mr. krenz 's few official <unk> overseas came a few months ago when he visited china after the <unk> in beijing
he later <unk> the chinese government 's response during a separate visit to west germany
east german <unk> in particular fears mr. krenz in part because of an <unk> in january N when he was believed to have ordered the arrest of hundreds of <unk> who had sought <unk> in the church
however mr. krenz also has a reputation for being <unk> <unk>
his <unk> ability to read the <unk> popular mood in east germany is best <unk> by his apparent break with his old <unk> mr. honecker
indeed according to west german government sources he was one of the leaders in the power struggle that <unk> mr. honecker
in recent days mr. krenz has sought to project a <unk> image
according to a report widely <unk> in east berlin it was mr. krenz who ordered police to stop using <unk> force against <unk> in <unk>
he does n't want to have the image of the <unk> man says <unk> <unk> an expert at the <unk> institute of east european and international studies in <unk>
he 's not a <unk> he wants to have the image of a <unk>
as part of his image <unk> mr. krenz is expected to take modest steps toward reform to <unk> confidence among the people and <unk> the party 's authority
besides <unk> other senior politburo officials who <unk> themselves with mr. honecker mr. krenz could <unk> controls on the news media free up travel restrictions and establish a <unk> with various dissident groups
but will it be enough
west german government officials and western analysts are <unk>
he does n't <unk> what people want so the <unk> will go on mr. <unk> predicts
at the same time the expectations of the east german people are great and will continue to grow
says one west german official what 's necessary now is the process of <unk>
not just that people are being heard but that their interests are being taken seriously
chancellor <unk> meanwhile has <unk> mr. krenz to open discussions with <unk> on a wide range of <unk>
reports in the west german press citing sources in east germany suggest mr. krenz may serve only as a bridge between mr. honecker and a <unk> reform leader
adding to that speculation is mr. krenz 's reputation as a heavy <unk> who is said to also suffer from <unk>
this is a <unk> process and we 're <unk> the first step the <unk> official adds
the <unk> of mr. krenz may also <unk> moscow
soviet leader <unk> gorbachev has <unk> hard for a change in east germany 's <unk> stance
two <unk> party leaders <unk> by moscow as possible <unk> to mr. honecker <unk> party secretary <unk> <unk> and politburo member <unk> <unk> were passed over
if mr. krenz <unk> to <unk> policies the pressure from the soviet union could <unk>
in moscow mr. gorbachev sent mr. krenz a <unk> <unk> that appeared to urge the new leadership to <unk> growing calls for change
according to the soviet news agency <unk> gorbachev expressed the conviction that the leadership of the socialist <unk> party of east germany being sensitive to the demands of the time will find solutions to complicated problems the <unk> german democratic republic <unk>
a force of younger <unk> members in the east german <unk> has for some time been pushing for <unk> within their country
the older generation has been <unk> between a fear of <unk> with the status <unk> and a fear of what might happen if they did n't
from the perspective of east germany 's old guard reforms that <unk> of <unk> and <unk> democracy could eliminate their country 's reason for being
unlike the other nations of the bloc east germany is a <unk> of the cold war
<unk> the differences still <unk> europe and the vast international <unk> that <unk> wo n't <unk> the <unk> of a poland or a hungary
but it could ultimately lead to german <unk> and the <unk> of east germany from the <unk>
which is what the old guard fears
i 'm sure they 'll <unk> a reform that will be a <unk> for the <unk> 's future as a separately <unk> state says michael simmons a british <unk> whose book on east germany <unk> the <unk> country was published this month
up to now that <unk> has <unk> of a <unk> effort by former leader walter <unk> to establish the country 's international <unk> followed by mr. honecker 's campaign to build the east bloc 's only successful <unk> economy into a consumer <unk>
neither man achieved <unk>
early in N mr. honecker and his team stopped paying thin <unk> to mr. gorbachev and joined with <unk> in <unk> any <unk> for <unk> in their systems
the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in contrast declared their <unk> to reform while doing nothing concrete about it
the east german media soon began <unk> mr. gorbachev 's <unk> only as <unk> <unk> and giving space to his opponents
by late N they were <unk> soviet publications
the country abandoned its former <unk> to socialist <unk> and took to <unk> instead that each country in the bloc ought to travel its own road
mr. honecker <unk> of generally <unk> <unk> laws of socialism and left no room for debate
with this year 's <unk> in china and the soviet union and the drive to democracy in poland and hungary the east german leadership grew still more defensive
politburo member <unk> <unk> <unk> to a <unk> concern over <unk> democracy
under the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> of socialism he said forces are at work that are <unk> to eliminate socialism

meanwhile the man mr. krenz <unk> has left an <unk> mark on east german society
<unk> by the <unk> during world war ii for his political <unk> mr. honecker <unk> the <unk> generation of committed communist leaders in eastern europe who took their <unk> from moscow
he was a socialist <unk> who felt <unk> by west germany 's enormous <unk> <unk> and the <unk> government 's <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of his state

with airline deals in a <unk> <unk> wall street trader michael steinhardt could have trouble <unk> out of usair group traders say
only a week ago when airline buy-out <unk> was already <unk> down mr. steinhardt was engaged in a <unk> with usair
he was threatening to take over the carrier after spending an estimated $ N million to build an N N usair stake for his investment clients
the <unk> raider even hired an investment banker to give <unk> to his takeover threat which was widely interpreted as an effort to <unk> out an <unk> for usair or for his own stake
in fighting usair mr. steinhardt was <unk> against another investor <unk> <unk> <unk> who bought into usair to help fend off mr. steinhardt
mr. <unk> 's firm <unk> <unk> holds a much bigger stake in the carrier than mr. steinhardt 's firm steinhardt partners
now in the wake of ual 's troubles in financing its buy-out the airline <unk> game has been <unk>
instead of hoping to sell his usair stake at analysts ' estimated buy-out price of $ N a share mr. steinhardt is stuck with roughly N million usair shares that cost him $ N on average but yesterday closed at N N up N in new york stock exchange composite trading
it does n't make sense to <unk> out at this price mr. steinhardt says though he has stopped his takeover talk and now <unk> usair managers ' operating <unk>
at the current price the usair holding represents N N of all the assets that mr. steinhardt manages
a week ago usair stock briefly soared above N after a report in <unk> today that mr. steinhardt might launch a hostile bid for the carrier though takeover speculators say they were skeptical
if usair is worth N as a takeover and the stock went to N the market was saying steinhardt 's presence was n't worth anything in terms of getting a deal done says a veteran takeover <unk>
traders say this all goes to show that even the <unk> money manager can get infected with crowd <unk>
in trying to <unk> usair mr. steinhardt abandoned his usual role as a passive investor and ran into <unk>
moreover unlike mr. <unk> who often holds big stakes in companies for years mr. steinhardt has n't in the past done much long-term investing
mr. steinhardt who runs about $ N billion for steinhardt partners made his name as a <unk> trader moving in and out of stocks with <unk> <unk> himself and his investment clients
meanwhile his big losses for instance in N 's crash generally have been trading losses
so some see a special <unk> in the fact that mr. steinhardt the trader now is <unk> with a massive <unk> airline holding
analysts say usair stock might lose four or five points if the steinhardt stake was dumped all at once
as a result mr. steinhardt must <unk> himself to selling usair at a loss or to holding the shares as an <unk> investment
long-term investing that 's not steinhardt 's style <unk> an investor who once worked at steinhardt partners
he does n't usually risk that much unless he thinks he has an <unk> in the <unk> adds another steinhardt partners <unk>
in recent days traders say usair has been buying its own shares as part of a program to retire about eight million usair shares though the carrier wo n't discuss its buy-back program
if usair stepped up its share purchases that might be a way for mr. steinhardt to get out says <unk> <unk> a merrill lynch analyst
but usair might not want to help mr. steinhardt he adds
in N usair chairman <unk> <unk> <unk> when <unk> world airlines chairman <unk> icahn threatened to take over the carrier
mr. icahn a much more <unk> raider than mr. steinhardt eventually sold a big usair stake at a <unk> profit through bear stearns
mr. steinhardt also could take that <unk>
he <unk> big trading commissions on wall street firms
however with airline stocks <unk> he might not get a very good price for his shares traders say
especially <unk> for mr. steinhardt say people close to him is that usair 's mr. <unk> wo n't even take his telephone calls
while usair is n't considered <unk> <unk> its <unk> including the sale in august of a N N stake in the company to mr. <unk> 's <unk> <unk> are pretty strong
usair 's deal with mr. <unk> was n't exactly a <unk> example of shareholder democracy mr. steinhardt says
since last april the investor has made seven so-called <unk> filings in usair as he bought and sold the company 's stock
such <unk> of big holdings often are used by <unk> to try to <unk> a company 's managers and to <unk> interest in the stock
but of course it would be highly unusual for an investment fund such as steinhardt partners to take over a company
usair and mr. <unk> wo n't talk about mr. steinhardt at all
analysts say usair has great promise
by the second half of N usair stock could hit N says <unk> <unk> of shearson lehman hutton
she thinks traders should buy the stock if it <unk> to N
but meanwhile usair is expected to show losses or lackluster profit for several quarters as it tries to <unk> <unk> airlines which it acquired
moreover some investors think a recession or renewed <unk> wars will <unk> airline stocks in coming months
however mr. steinhardt says he 's comfortable holding usair as an investment
while he has bought and sold some usair shares in recent days he says that <unk> to rumors he has n't tried to <unk> his holding
mr. steinhardt adds that he bought usair stock earlier this year as part of a fundamental investment in the airline group
in N mr. steinhardt says he made money trading in texas air amr and ual
overall his investments so far this year are showing gains of about N N he adds
does mr. steinhardt <unk> his <unk> into the <unk> game
people close to the investor say that was an experiment he is unlikely to <unk>
i do n't think you 'll find i 'm making a radical change in my traditional investment style mr. steinhardt says

but those represent long-term strategies that probably wo n't succeed quickly even if they turn out to be the right ones
in the <unk> the strategies will increase expenses
commodore had been <unk> on its consumer business to stay <unk> healthy to support its efforts in other areas mainly in getting schools and businesses to use its <unk> which has <unk> graphics yet has been slow to catch on because it is n't <unk> with apple computer inc. or international business machines corp. hardware
but sales to consumers have become difficult during the past several months even in west germany which has been by far commodore 's strongest market
the commodore N and N mainly used for children 's educational software and games had surprised market researchers by continuing to produce strong sales even though other <unk> personal computers now operate several times as fast and have much more memory
commodore has said it expects sales to rebound but market researchers have said that sales of the <unk> products may finally be <unk> off

<unk> lang who this week completed the acquisition of the publisher of ms. and sassy is <unk> about the challenge he is taking on
mr. lang admits that ms. is in <unk> <unk> and that sassy needs big promotional dollars to keep it alive
but the <unk> publisher has moved quickly and <unk> to deal with the magazines ' problems
last friday he told the staff of ms. that the magazine in january would begin publishing without advertising
mr. lang will do away with expensive circulation drives not to <unk> sales staff and attempt to publish the <unk> magazine supported by circulation revenue alone
any <unk> can publish a <unk> magazine
i want to publish one that succeeds said mr. lang
for ms. it 's time to publish for the <unk> not the <unk>
as for sassy which <unk> directly with news corp. 's <unk> magazine mr. lang says that in the next two years he will spend $ N million promoting and <unk> the magazine
though sassy has grown quickly since its debut in march N it has been the target of conservative <unk> and <unk> advertisers who <unk> at its frank editorial matter on <unk> problems
mr. lang said the former australian owners of sassy were <unk> by the <unk> majority
their reaction was to do nothing and ride it out
he said sassy will keep its <unk> tone but added we will keep a close watch on the editorial <unk> of the magazine
sassy already has recovered circulation has quickly passed the N mark and advertising pages have <unk> this year at more than N
what 's more mr. lang says he has what all publishers wish for a <unk> <unk> <unk>

besides ms. and sassy closely held lang communications includes success a magazine for entrepreneurs and small businesses and working woman and working mother two monthly magazines
working woman with circulation near one million and working mother with N circulation are legitimate magazine success stories
the magazine success however was for years lackluster and <unk>
only recently has it been <unk> <unk> and its editorial product improved
success is expected to gain at least because of the recent <unk> of rival venture another magazine for growing companies

the venture formed in N was supposed to be time 's <unk> safe <unk> into women 's magazines
mr. lang surprised time soon after joining forces when he said he would <unk> rates <unk> with advertisers a practice common in broadcasting but considered <unk> by magazine publishers
in addition <unk> 's put in a less than <unk> performance
until a recent comeback it saw steep losses in ad pages and circulation
time executives complained about the <unk> editorial quality and in the end one time executive who asked not to be identified said <unk> <unk> 's and the joint venture were an <unk>
mr. lang <unk> that time 's <unk> changed
their management changed right after the venture was formed and i do n't think they were comfortable getting into the competitive wars of women 's service magazines
today mr. lang believes his magazines will offer what many women 's magazines do n't
we write straight for women on their level he said
we do n't have passive readers
mr. lang points out that even success in part <unk> the company 's image since about N N of its <unk> is <unk>
mr. lang has named <unk> <unk> N as group publisher of new york-based lang communications
she will <unk> working woman working mother and success magazines and retain her post as publisher of working woman

but there are other long-term effects that raise serious questions about the ability of california 's <unk> to <unk> a major temblor
it could easily be two years before the <unk> <unk> that helps <unk> oakland with san francisco is <unk> and the cost to build a new stretch of highway could <unk> to more than $ N million said charles j. <unk> deputy district director in los angeles of the california department of transportation <unk> <unk>
<unk> in sacramento said total damage from the collapsed highway is estimated at around $ N million
the aftershocks of the highway <unk> are <unk> in los angeles as well as local politicians <unk> yesterday against plans to bring <unk> to los angeles <unk> by N
<unk> plans to add a second <unk> for <unk> and car <unk> above the <unk> of a <unk> stretch of the <unk> freeway just south of los angeles near the <unk> <unk>
los angeles county <unk> kenneth <unk> yesterday <unk> to fight the <unk> of <unk> in the area
<unk> abandoned <unk> in the early 1970s following the N <unk> earthquake that <unk> freeway <unk> just north of los angeles mr. <unk> explained
that temblor measured N on the richter scale tuesday 's was
so why even consider <unk> <unk> now
we 've run out of places to build <unk> in <unk> and the only place to go is up mr. <unk> said although he acknowledges there are many <unk> including cost
but as for safety he says <unk> <unk> built today with the heavily <unk> concrete and <unk> columns required after the <unk> quake should <unk> a <unk> temblor of N to N on the richter scale
reasons for the collapse of the <unk> freeway were <unk> yesterday
but most structural engineers attributed the <unk> to <unk> <unk> of the columns that supported the <unk> and the fact that the ground <unk> the highway is largely <unk> and can become <unk> or <unk> in a major quake
the <unk> <unk> designed in the <unk> and completed in N was supported by columns that apparently <unk> the kind of steel <unk> used in highways today
while the <unk> did have long metal <unk> running <unk> through them for <unk> they apparently <unk> an adequate number of metal ties that run <unk> through the <unk> said <unk> <unk> a structural <unk> in los angeles
<unk> today uses a <unk> of the design mr. <unk> describes with <unk> steel <unk> inside
but in the case of the <unk> freeway the lack of such support caused the core of the columns to <unk> and <unk> under the weight of the second <unk> <unk> <unk> who were <unk> up in <unk> <unk> traffic on the lower <unk> nearly N feet below
officials of the state agency did n't have any immediate <unk> why the <unk> did n't hold up
<unk> <unk> the highway in N as part of a $ N million <unk> project using steel <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the freeway to the columns and prevent the structure from <unk> in a quake
<unk> spokesman jim <unk> in sacramento declined to identify the engineering firm that did the <unk> work
liability in the bridge and road <unk> will <unk> around whether government took reasonable care to build and maintain the structures says john <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> attorney who <unk> in highway design and maintenance cases
the firm brought in to <unk> the structure could be <unk> as well
the results of the quake certainly raise questions about whether reasonable care was taken mr. <unk> says
given the <unk> history of the bay area it seems to me that a N earthquake is a <unk> event
<unk> ' mr. <unk> <unk> the agency 's work on the <unk> freeway
the work was done <unk> he said
<unk> we had a severe earthquake of significant <unk> and it was just something the structure could n't <unk>
<unk> <unk> this year began working on a second round of <unk> <unk> of <unk> around the state this time <unk> freeway columns in steel <unk> to <unk> them
but only bridges supported with single <unk> of columns were top priority and the <unk> freeway supported by double <unk> was left out mr. <unk> explained
the reason is that the technology is such that we 're not able to <unk> <unk> structures he said

the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the san francisco bay area rated a N on the richter scale did n't match the great earthquake of N rated at N

mr. johnson of the berkeley <unk> station said <unk> can be done if it 's <unk> <unk>
you can drive <unk> on it and build on it
he cited the example of san francisco 's financial district where many new glass <unk> <unk> almost <unk>
but the public policy issues raised by earthquake damage will be difficult to address mr. johnson predicted
the attention <unk> of the public is short he said
we 've known for years and years we 've got lots of old <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> buildings
one old building the golden state bank building on front street had its <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> off by the shock of the quake leaving a <unk> of its third floor open to the air while <unk> of <unk> <unk> tumbled to the street below narrowly missing <unk> <unk> and cars

it 's a danger
we know it 's there
and <unk> or later we have to do something about it
the <unk> is <unk> because this week 's earthquake while major and followed by hundreds of aftershocks did n't release enough <unk> energy <unk> along the <unk> to <unk> more and bigger <unk> soon

dow officials were <unk> that the company would earn less than $ N a share this year even before they announced in july a plan to acquire N N of <unk> laboratories inc

dow has n't said exactly what impact the <unk> acquisition will have on N earnings
dow blamed the third-quarter earnings drop on several factors including <unk> prices for <unk> and other basic chemicals a slower u.s. economy and a stronger dollar which made dow 's exports from the u.s. more expensive to overseas customers

whether or not great cases make <unk> as justice holmes asserted who can doubt that when great <unk> hearings turn on the <unk> 's response to these great cases they make bad judicial history
<unk> <unk> 's battle for justice how the bork <unk> shook america <unk> N pages $ N is a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of these hearings done with <unk> <unk> but with a <unk> legal <unk>
while the book <unk> <unk> its <unk> the title itself is <unk>
what shook america was not a battle for justice but for <unk> power in which an army of judicial activists <unk> over a judge they had <unk>
in its basic structure and style the book is <unk> with <unk> character <unk> <unk> action and <unk> <unk> of the sort more likely to be <unk> in a washington <unk> than in a constitutional history
mr. <unk> seems to believe that the hearings could have gone either way
i doubt that
given democratic <unk> with the reagan <unk> and court <unk> the <unk> plans in place and mr. bork 's paper <unk> of vulnerable <unk> it was pretty clear that judge bork never stood much chance of being confirmed
as mr. <unk> himself says the <unk> of raw <unk> was in the air
perhaps because they won mr. bork 's <unk> come through more <unk> than his <unk>
ralph <unk> was the <unk> <unk> <unk> a conglomerate of pressure groups into an <unk> <unk> force
harvard 's <unk> <unk> was the constitutional heavy <unk> out legal strategies for the senators and witnesses to follow
but it was ted kennedy who <unk> most effectively with his <unk> <unk> of robert bork 's america the <unk> of <unk> <unk> that would follow <unk> he claimed from the positions mr. bork had taken over the space of two decades
sen. kennedy never mind his <unk> <unk> for the <unk> high ground <unk> <unk>
i add two others
republican sen. <unk> specter of pennsylvania engaged the <unk> in a <unk> contest aimed at showing that mr. bork was willing to stretch the constitution in one area free speech while remaining <unk> in all the others
it achieved a good media play and <unk> sen. specter and others to vote against mr. bork out of <unk>
further <unk> came from left legal <unk> ronald <unk> who in the new york review of books <unk> a picture of a constitutional <unk> <unk> reading his personal <unk> into the constitution particularly in the area of original intent
the charge of being outside the <unk> of legal thought <unk> <unk> mr. bork 's <unk> standing leaving him <unk> on the <unk>
the <unk> still might have been <unk> if a number of democratic <unk> in the south and southwest had broken party lines
but democratic sen. bennett johnson of <unk> <unk> the little band that <unk> blacks and women could <unk> the margin to <unk> them in their next senate elections

mr. bork 's opponents <unk> the <unk> held it and kept it
yet with the <unk> <unk> of <unk> kennedy an N <unk> only slightly less <unk> of judicial <unk> than mr. bork the democrats may have won the battle but lost the war
another <unk> however was the <unk> message the bork hearings sent into the judicial culture from which the supreme court <unk> its <unk>
the word went <unk> to every law school that those with federal court <unk> must travel a safe constitutional <unk> with no paper <unk> and no <unk> to their <unk> or <unk>
unfortunately the author simply does n't supply the <unk> <unk> to <unk> his <unk> <unk>
he has too <unk> <unk> the case for the <unk> law school culture

he would <unk> it also in <unk> <unk> a <unk> constitutional <unk> mr. bork 's <unk> friend at <unk> whose influence on the judge goes well beyond mr. <unk> 's reporting
still the long view of robert bork as constitutional <unk> must be a <unk> one
his strength lies in his <unk> <unk> which <unk> the court clear of <unk> group pressures and leaves most decisions in a democracy to elected <unk> and executives
unfortunately mr. bork failed to <unk> between such pressures and the <unk> of great issues critical to a society that must be settled <unk> if it is to <unk>
the question of <unk> schools in brown vs. board of education was such an issue
in our time abortion has become another best left to a line of supreme court decisions rather than to the <unk> of N state <unk>
a <unk> and growing consensus of americans clearly <unk> to apply the right to <unk> in <unk> matters decided in the <unk> case to abortion as well
one can understand mr. bork 's fear that the new right to <unk> will become <unk> <unk> though a supreme court <unk> of men and women with <unk> <unk> and a sense of limits should be able to manage it
what is certain is that if americans allow another happening like the <unk> bork <unk> <unk> it will be at their <unk>

sotheby 's inc. the world 's biggest auction house is taking a huge wall <unk> risk on the outcome of the sale of art from the estate of john t. dorrance jr. the <unk> <unk> co. <unk>
the financial services division has guaranteed the dorrance family that it will receive a minimum of $ N million for the collection <unk> of what the bids for the art works total people close to the transaction say
the collection which includes two early <unk> a van <unk> a <unk> other <unk> furniture and <unk> went on sale last night in the first of six <unk>
what sotheby 's is doing closely <unk> an underwriting by an investment bank
a corporation that wants to sell stock or bonds goes to a wall street firm which purchases the securities <unk> <unk> the financial risk of finding buyers
if the investment bank can sell the securities at a higher price than it paid the <unk> it makes a profit
at the initial sale last night for example the sale <unk> the <unk> <unk> bids totaled $ N million
that was slightly above sotheby 's <unk> estimate of $ N million
normally sotheby 's would have earned N N of the total in commissions
instead people familiar with the transaction said the auction house <unk> to <unk> that percentage in order to obtain the collection and in exchange for taking a bigger <unk> of proceeds exceeding $ N million
art dealers say that while auction houses occasionally guarantee the seller of a highly <unk> work of art a minimum price a financial commitment of this size is unprecedented
<unk> d. <unk> president of sotheby 's north america division <unk> <unk> it offered the dorrance <unk> a <unk> guarantee calling such reports <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> catalog for the sale however appears the statement sotheby 's has an interest in the property in this catalog
<unk> a sotheby 's spokeswoman the statement means exactly what it says
we have some level of financial interest in the collection
we do n't disclose <unk>
frank <unk> a lawyer for the dorrance estate with the philadelphia law firm of morgan lewis & <unk> declines to comment on the financial arrangements
sotheby 's made the $ N million guarantee to keep the dorrance collection away from its <unk> auction house christie 's international plc christie 's has handled smaller sales for the dorrance family over the years
when christie 's officials asked why the firm was n't picked to sell the dorrance collection representatives of the dorrance family told us it was a question of financial <unk> said michael <unk> christie 's head of <unk> and modern <unk>
<unk> who have made their money on wall street have become an increasingly important part of the art business and their money has helped fuel the art <unk> but recently it appears sotheby 's has been returning the <unk>
in november N sotheby 's essentially offered a wall <unk> bridge loan of about $ N million to australian businessman alan bond to enable him to purchase <unk> van <unk> 's <unk> for $ N million
it was the highest bid in history for a work of art
but two weeks ago sotheby 's said that it has the <unk> under <unk> and key because the loan had not been fully <unk>
sotheby 's is offering such deals because it 's an art sellers ' market at least where the best works are concerned says ralph <unk> an attorney and author of the book art law
there seems to be a lot of art for sale but there 's more competition
the competition gives the seller the ability to cut a better deal he says
the dorrance family will still receive a substantial portion of the auction proceeds above $ N million people familiar with the transaction said
but it 's likely that sotheby 's will take a higher than usual commission called an <unk> on the amount exceeding the guarantee
sotheby 's has been aggressively promoting the dorrance sale
at a news conference last may announcing plans for the auction sotheby 's estimated its value in excess of $ N million
more recently sotheby 's has predicted the collection will <unk> $ N million
that 's the highest estimate for a single collection in auction history
the decision to put the entire collection on the block <unk> many since mr. dorrance had served as chairman of the philadelphia <unk> of art and it had been assumed many of the works would be <unk> to the institution
at last night 's sale N of N works that sold were purchased by <unk> international <unk> the <unk> unit of <unk> financial a japanese conglomerate that owns N N of christie 's
meanwhile sotheby 's guarantee is raising <unk> in the art world
the consumer has to throw out the idea that the auction house is a <unk> <unk> says new york art dealer david <unk>
while he adds that he has no problem with auction houses who sell works in which they have a financial interest it ought not to be <unk> in some small <unk>
in such <unk> he says the house is going to put the best light on things
for example an auction house 's comments on the condition of a work of art that is up for sale should be looked at with very open eyes he says
there 's more and more of this <unk> going on at every level says <unk> miller president of art funding corp. an art <unk>
dealers and auction houses know if they do n't lay out a half a million for this another one will it 's that competitive
in january two small new york <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> fine <unk> <unk> a major art collection owned by the <unk> family away from rival <unk> <unk> with an <unk> payment of about $ N million
a christie 's spokeswoman said that while the auction house sometimes <unk> its seller 's commission to attract art works it still gets a commission from the buyer christie 's wo n't offer financial guarantees because christie 's believes its primary role is as an auction house and therefore as an agent for buyer and seller not as a bank
<unk> krenz the man <unk> yesterday to become east germany 's new leader faces the same task that has fallen to <unk> socialist colleagues <unk> a country in crisis
but unlike the other new leaders in the east bloc mr. krenz will face an immediate threat to his nation 's very <unk> german <unk>
mr. krenz age N is known as an <unk> <unk> one likely to continue the method of running a country that the berlin wall made famous
even if he were to change his <unk> and become another <unk> <unk> however he would still stand a good chance of losing a country
mr. krenz almost certainly will be a younger version of <unk> honecker his <unk> <unk> as dictator
mr. krenz has followed much the same career path as mr. honecker both spent years <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> group that is the communist regime 's principal <unk> for <unk> young germans into socialist citizens
more recently mr. krenz has been in charge of east german security and is the <unk> member of the ruling politburo
faced with another mr. honecker so many <unk> east germans are likely to <unk> that the two german <unk> will get their <unk> de <unk> on west german ground
but if east germany 's <unk> politburo does <unk> up enough to permit mr. krenz to make serious efforts at reform he will face a challenge just as fundamental
<unk> socialism means <unk> the east german state 's reason for <unk> and with it the <unk> for its <unk> and its wall
in this scenario it 's hard to <unk> that a <unk> <unk> of the federal republic could avoid being pulled into some kind of <unk> economic federal or stronger with west germany
mr. krenz may need a bit of time to <unk> his empire which would do a lot to promote <unk> scenario one
<unk> in west germany have already <unk> the <unk> by <unk> an <unk> placed by mr. honecker wanted one people
the west german <unk> in <unk> <unk> and warsaw are continuing to find <unk> at their <unk>
of course east germany true to its <unk> could <unk> its <unk> yet further
two of the last <unk> of the honecker regime were to close the border to <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> in some <unk> along the <unk>
but with world-wide opinion even apparently in moscow against east germany the country would have to turn itself into an <unk> to <unk> down further on <unk>
there have been some reports that mr. krenz is moving to <unk> his reputation <unk> rumors that it was he who kept east germany 's state police off <unk> ' <unk> at the country 's dismal <unk> <unk> <unk> earlier this month
but even if he effects a <unk> <unk> he will face a serious <unk> crisis and <unk> scenario two
the problem is one that east germany shares with other <unk> such as north korea but one it must <unk> alone in the east bloc
when poland moves to reform it can at least <unk> on its past however <unk> and <unk> joseph <unk> 's <unk> republic it was a <unk> democracy
<unk> <unk> can <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the same period in their country
even the soviet union has peter the great to <unk> should it choose to
but east germany is merely the land of truly existing socialism
beyond that it has to compete with west germany for a claim to the german <unk>
up to now the main <unk> of the worker and <unk> state has been the <unk> of socialism
with talk today of a second economic <unk> in west germany east germany no longer can <unk> itself with being the economic star in a <unk> league
without moscow 's military and party behind it east germany runs the risk of <unk>
if it goes <unk> and increases trade with west germany it will convert itself <unk> into an economic <unk> of the federal republic
there 's a certain <unk> <unk> at work here it 's particularly appropriate and <unk> that the land that produced <unk> <unk> should prove socialism 's failure in an experiment that uses its own people as controls
there may be forces that would delay this scenario
<unk> are the last to <unk> and germans are an <unk> people
the <unk> who <unk> <unk> gorbachev at east berlin 's airport earlier this month were n't <unk> go <unk> they were <unk> <unk> help us
<unk> on the other side of the border can also slow the process
<unk> <unk> 's <unk> conservative coalition is <unk> <unk> true to the west german constitution by making more than N people of german <unk> <unk> citizens this year alone

the drug which is still in the <unk> phase has n't been approved yet by the food and drug <unk> and its long-term effects are <unk>
but researchers say the drug called <unk> could <unk> the <unk> field by reducing <unk> side effects and by <unk> rejection rates
rejection has been the major <unk> in the approximately N <unk> <unk> performed world-wide each year
researchers began using the drug in february on patients who had received <unk> <unk> heart and <unk> <unk>
only two of N <unk> have been rejected
the drug discovered in N is <unk> from <unk> <unk> found in japan
the pittsburgh patients are the first <unk> to be given the drug which is made by <unk> pharmaceutical co
we 're <unk> by it because it 's worked so fast said dr. thomas e. <unk> director of the university of pittsburgh <unk> program at a news conference here yesterday
we consider it a <unk> drug like one for aids said dr. john <unk> an <unk> at the university of pittsburgh
researchers say they believe <unk> is N times more effective than the traditional <unk> drug <unk> made by swiss pharmaceutical giant <unk> ltd
they are also encouraged by the relatively <unk> side effects of <unk> compared with <unk> which can cause <unk> failure <unk> <unk> and other problems
the side effects of <unk> have made the <unk> for its success rather high dr. <unk> said
dr. <unk> said that <unk> would not be available in the market for at least a year and that the fda approval process usually takes three years to five years
there are no firm plans to expand the <unk> program beyond the university of pittsburgh whose hospital <unk> the most <unk> in the world
researchers could n't estimate the cost of the drug when it reaches the market but they said <unk> will enable patients to cut hospital <unk> by N N and reduce the number of blood tests used to monitor the <unk> of <unk> and other drugs among <unk> <unk>
dr. <unk> said the research has been largely financed by the national institute of health and by university funds and that <unk> did n't give the hospital any grants

to be sure the threat has hit home down here
yet in mr. laband 's <unk> of <unk> <unk> human <unk> and <unk> are the only <unk> <unk> <unk>
allowing <unk> prices for <unk> would indeed <unk> the lines at stores as he contends
but not because resources are going to their most efficient use leaving <unk> goods <unk> to those buyers who place the highest value on them
rather lines would <unk> because at higher prices many victims could not afford <unk> such as food and medical supplies
it is <unk> to <unk> that a poor <unk> woman can not receive immediate relief for her family at fair prices because she does not have as much to protect as a rich family
moreover essential relief supplies such as <unk> must be distributed throughout the population because of potential health problems from <unk> food and possible <unk> of <unk>
such <unk> effects give the state a right to <unk> in the <unk> and temporarily <unk> <unk> of resources

why should they have to <unk> with <unk> <unk> in to turn a quick profit

mr. laband gives us an idea why economists ' <unk> are usually wrong
they set up <unk> <unk> <unk> from reality and then try to reason from them
i 'm surprised he did n't <unk> letting people <unk> since that behavior can also be <unk> in a disaster and every individual has an <unk> to alter the distribution of income in his favor
price controls were so <unk> <unk> by <unk> because price <unk> in this situation is equivalent to <unk>

would mr. laband also suggest that the red cross <unk> army military units police fire departments rescue units and individual citizens <unk> their efforts to assist hugo 's victims because they <unk> with his concept of the free market
what about those <unk> people all over the country who are <unk> food water and other <unk> of life to these people who could be any of us
should they too stop <unk> with his free market
maybe he thinks they should also sell to the highest <unk>

the budget <unk> had to be <unk> with by the oct. N deadline and these senate democrats refused to agree to allow a vote to <unk> capital gains to the budget bill <unk> it would pass
denied a vote on <unk> the gop leadership in the senate on friday morning was <unk> with a hard choice
it could throw in the <unk> and hope to win on capital gains late this month or it could follow the white house strategy to veto <unk> unless capital gains was <unk>
the u.s. chamber of commerce has been in the <unk> in supporting the bush proposal
it <unk> the white house strategy <unk> it to be the <unk> way to victory
at <unk> friday a senior white house official advised richard <unk> the chamber 's chief economist that the white house would not agree to a budget <unk> bill unless it had firm assurances that a vote on <unk> would be permitted in the senate
two hours later the first word emerged on capitol hill that the administration had agreed to <unk> with no such assurances from senate democrats
mr. <unk> was <unk> <unk> the office of richard darman director of the office of management and budget and the administration 's chief strategist on this issue
he left a message <unk> mr. darman of selling out
it was the senate republicans though who had edged away from the veto strategy
the stock market reacted as mr. <unk> did <unk> as it <unk> the news that mr. darman 's strategy had been abandoned
the stock market after all represents the <unk> expectations about the value of the future income <unk> of the nation 's capital stock <unk> to present value
why should it be so surprising that a N N cut in the capital-gains tax would have such an enormous impact on the value of the nation 's capital stock
the total value of privately held assets is easily more than $ N trillion
the value traded on the exchanges is close to $ N trillion
if the tax on any gain to those assets was doubled would n't the value fall to the owners of the assets
is n't it reasonable to assume that the asset you own would be worth more if the government suddenly announced that if you sold it you would be able to keep N N more of its gain than you previously believed
indeed the stock market 's steady advance this year <unk> with president bush 's success in <unk> his capital-gains proposal
a N N cut in this year 's capital gains alone amounts to roughly $ N billion
we 're talking real money
when richard <unk> advised the financial press that the market crash was caused by the setback to capital gains he was generally ignored and <unk> <unk>
instead the press <unk> <unk> accepted the notion that a <unk> in the takeover financing of united airlines <unk> knocked N N off the value of the nation 's capital stock and caused <unk> around the world
mr. <unk> was <unk> out an <unk> <unk> through wall street while conventional <unk> had <unk> on the ual <unk>
why is this happening
for one thing quite a number of the leading <unk> on wall street are not portfolio managers who understand that the value of assets is greatly affected by how government taxes those assets
they are economists and financial reporters who <unk> with the view that a capital-gains tax cut benefits the rich
yet they <unk> think that wall street is <unk> to losing the tax cut that seemed so close friday morning and is now <unk>
the market rebound monday followed weekend assurances from mr. darman that the administration has other plans to win the cut which is alive and well
sen. <unk> 's argument is that a capital-gains tax cut would be bad for the economy in the longer run
it would <unk> lead to an increase in <unk> <unk> rates in N he thinks when the white house is forced to ask for higher taxes to meet budget targets
that is with capital gains cut the <unk> of the N accord will be gone and political <unk> will push up <unk> rates
the <unk> which he has heard is that if he and his fellow democrats are successful in <unk> the president 's proposal the revenue gap will open up <unk> in N because of the weakened economy
in this atmosphere there would be no serious consideration of tax increases
if sen. <unk> would permit a vote on capital gains though it would pass christmas retail sales would be strong instead of <unk> by a falling stock market the N economy would be robust and the revenue gains at every level of government including new jersey 's would be surprisingly high
no tax increases would be necessary
the struggle over capital gains is the most important game in town
in washington and on wall street

the stock market 's <unk> gyrations during the past few days have made a lot of individual investors wish they could buy some sort of insurance
after all they wo n't soon <unk> the stock <unk> that became available after the october N crash
but while they want to be on the <unk> for similar buying opportunities now they 're afraid of being <unk> by another <unk> plunge
the solution at least for some investors may be a <unk> technique that 's well known to players in the <unk> market
called a married put the technique is carried out by purchasing a stock and <unk> buying a put option on that stock
it 's like fire insurance says <unk> <unk> the senior options strategist at <unk> & co
because a put option gives its owner the right but not the obligation to sell a fixed number of shares of the stock at a stated price on or before the option 's expiration date the investor is protected against a sudden drop in the stock 's price
but most investment advisers do n't <unk> using married puts all the time
that 's because the cost of buying put options <unk> into an investor 's profit when stock prices rise
this is the type of fire insurance you only buy when the nearby <unk> are on fire says mr. <unk>
you always want your house insured but you do n't always feel the need for your investments to be insured
in addition to <unk> new stock purchases the <unk> technique can be used to protect stocks that an investor already owns
in either case the investor faces three possible <unk>
if the stock goes up in price between now and the put 's expiration date the put will probably expire <unk>
the investor will be out the cost of the put which is called the premium and this loss will reduce the stock-market profit
if the stock <unk> at the same price between now and the put 's expiration date the investor 's loss will be limited to the cost of the put less any amount realized from a closing sale of the put
the <unk> scenario would be if the put expires <unk>
if the price of the stock declines the put will increase in value
once the stock price is less than the exercise price or strike price of the put the gain will match the loss on the stock dollar for dollar
the put <unk> a minimum selling price for the stock during its life
when a stock falls below the put 's strike price the investor simply sells the stock at a loss and <unk> sells the put at a profit
or the investor can exercise the put by <unk> the stock to his or her broker in return for payment from another investor who has sold a put on the same stock
brokers handle such transactions through the options clearing corp. which guarantees all option trades
the <unk> table shows how this strategy would work for three stocks
though not reflected in the table an investor should know that the cost of the option insurance can be <unk> offset by any dividends that the stock pays
for example <unk> inc. pays a quarterly dividend of N cents which would be received before the february option expires and thus reduce the cost of using the technique by that amount
in this case the investor 's risk would n't exceed N N of the total investment
to <unk> the calculations commissions on the option and underlying stock are n't included in the table
there are more than N stocks on which options may be bought and sold including some over-the-counter stocks
but some investors might prefer a <unk> strategy then <unk> their individual holdings
they can do this by purchasing index puts which are simply put options on <unk> that match broad <unk> of stocks
for instance the most popular index option is the s&p N option <unk> called the <unk>
it is based on the stocks that make up standard & poor 's <unk> index
unlike options on individual issues index options are settled only in cash and no stock is ever <unk>
but while index options are <unk> they have several <unk>
for one thing an investor 's portfolio might not closely match the s&p N
as a result the <unk> insurance may or may not fully protect an investor 's holdings in the event of a market decline
in addition <unk> options were suspended from trading last friday afternoon after the stock-market sell-off got under way and trading in the <unk> futures contract was halted
so an investor who wanted to realize a profit on <unk> puts after the trading suspension would have been out of <unk>
on the other hand only a handful of individual issues were suspended from trading on friday
normally once the underlying investment is suspended from trading the options on those investments also do n't trade
ultimately whether the insurance provided by purchasing puts is <unk> depends on the cost of the options
that cost rises in times of high market volatility
but it still might be cheaper than taking a major hit
the protection from using married puts is clearly <unk> to that <unk> by another options strategy some investors consider using during troubled times selling call options on stocks the investor owns
a call option is similar to a put except that it gives its owner the right to buy shares at a stated price until expiration
selling a call option gives an investor a small <unk> against a stock-market decline
that 's because it reduces the cost of the stock by the amount of premium received from the sale of the call
but if the price of the stock rises above the strike price of the option the stock is almost certain to be called away
and in that case the investor <unk> out on any major <unk> gain
these calculations exclude the effect of commissions paid and dividends received from the stock
all prices are as of monday 's close
hopes for quick <unk> of pending deficit-reduction legislation <unk> as efforts to <unk> the house version in advance of a house-senate conference broke down

this is one of the worst trade <unk> we 've had since the dollar <unk> out in N said <unk> dennis chief international economist at james <unk> inc

on oct. N of that year the announcement of an unusually large august trade deficit helped <unk> a steep market decline
the slide continued until the record <unk> market drop on oct. N
in N however the news was the latest in a string of <unk> on trade while the current report comes after a period of improvement
the <unk> trade report was played down by the bush administration
commerce secretary robert <unk> called the <unk> trade figures disappointing after two very good months
and white house spokesman <unk> fitzwater said the deficit was an <unk> increase adding that we 're <unk> that it simply is a <unk> situation and will turn around
but the figures <unk> the view of many private analysts that the improvement in the u.s. trade deficit has run out of <unk>
the figures today add further evidence to support the view that the improvement in the u.s. trade deficit has essentially <unk> out at a level of about a $ N billion annual rate said jeffrey scott a research fellow at the institute for international economics here
that 's still an improvement over last year but it leads one to <unk> that <unk> we 've gotten all the <unk> we can out of past dollar <unk> and past <unk> cuts in the federal budget deficit
exports declined for the second consecutive month in august slipping N N to $ N billion the commerce department reported
imports on the other hand <unk> N N to a record $ N billion
not only was august 's deficit far worse than july 's but the government revised the july figure substantially from the $ N billion deficit it had initially reported last month
many economists contend that deep cuts in the u.s. budget deficit are needed before further trade improvement can <unk>
that 's because the budget deficit <unk> an enormous <unk> in this country for both foreign goods and foreign capital <unk> the nation 's capacity to export
people are <unk> and <unk> of hearing about these <unk> but the <unk> are still there and they are still a problem said mr. <unk>
in addition the rise in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies over the past several months has increased the price of u.s. products in overseas markets and hurt the country 's <unk>
since march exports have been virtually flat
at the same time william t. <unk> international vice president at the u.s. chamber of commerce notes clearly the stronger dollar has made imports more attractive by causing their prices to decline
most economists expect the slowing u.s. economy to curb demand for imports
but they <unk> little substantial progress in exports unless the dollar and the federal budget deficit come down
the best result we could get from these numbers would be to see the administration and congress get serious about putting the u.s. on an <unk> competitive economic <unk> said howard lewis vice president of international economic affairs at the national association of manufacturers

commercial customers can purchase the same system through <unk> inc. a computer retailer based in san jose calif. for roughly $ N more
mr. jobs said the changes were prompted by <unk> from customers who are <unk> with the performance of the optical device which is n't offered as standard equipment by any rivals
another factor was that customers were asking why do n't you give us a cheaper system mr. jobs said at a conference on university computing here
<unk> devices can handle very large amounts of data and make it far easier to <unk> film <unk> or <unk> <unk> with a computer
but the technology while <unk> is far slower than the widely used hard drives
to get around the delays caused by the optical device <unk> which is next 's exclusive dealer to corporations has for months been advising customers to purchase hard drives with the machines
next 's decision to rely on the <unk> hard drive in every next computer does n't signal a <unk> from optical storage said mr. jobs who for years has said this technology will play a crucial role in the next decade
we 're extremely committed to optical storage technology he said
we think everything will go this way in a few years
he said that the next generation of optical drives will be as fast as hard drives but he depends on outside suppliers for the devices
but university computer specialists who <unk> the move called it a necessary <unk> from the cutting edge of technology and one that 's likely to increase next 's sales on <unk>
from the <unk> of being on the <unk> of technology this is a step <unk> said jerry w. <unk> a senior computing manager for the california state university system

broad acceptance of next 's computer also is <unk> by difficulty in <unk> software for it
most software is distributed on cheap <unk> <unk> but the next computer does n't come with a device that <unk> them

the irs also said that it would create the position of chief financial officer who will be hired from within the agency
irs commissioner <unk> t. goldberg said the changes are intended to bring <unk> to the agency which has an annual budget of more than $ N billion and <unk> about $ N trillion a year
my assessment and everyone 's assessment is that we do not have the kinds of information that let us <unk> and effectively <unk> and <unk> our budget mr. goldberg said
and we do n't have internal controls and discipline that we need to have to spend $ N billion <unk>
mr. goldberg who took over as head of the irs in july has been <unk> by what he <unk> the <unk> waste and lack of <unk> among the branches of the vast federal agency
the irs operates on a computer system designed in N which it has been trying to <unk> for years
and the agency which operated throughout fiscal N with a $ N million budget <unk> has been under a hiring <unk> since last fall
the new commissioner says that closer <unk> of how the agency uses its resources will go a long way toward <unk> its ability to <unk> more tax revenue
i think that you will see a significant improvement in the budget <unk> and <unk> process which in turn i believe will result in a significant increase in revenue he said
the irs hopes to fill the new positions soon

although the jobs will probably pay between $ N and $ N a year irs officials are confident that they can attract <unk> candidates from the private sector
you 're telling someone they can spend the next three or four or five or six years of their life bringing about the most difficult and costly <unk> of an information system on the civil side ever mr. goldberg said

and he is <unk> the names of those who <unk> the <unk> to <unk> them during their brief time in control of his headquarters
more <unk> to be <unk> with
in the two weeks since the <unk> which the u.s. <unk> backed mr. noriega has been at his most <unk> and efficient in maintaining power
yet while the failed coup is a major u.s. foreign policy <unk> it is merely the latest chapter in a <unk> relationship between mr. noriega and washington that <unk> back three decades
america 's war on the dictator over the past two years following his indictment on drug charges in february N is the <unk> of that relationship
before american foreign policy set out to <unk> noriega it helped create him out of the <unk> of panama 's long history of <unk> and <unk>
for most of the past N years the <unk> was one of <unk>
in N for example when mr. noriega was both a <unk> at an <unk> military academy in <unk> and a <unk> for the u.s. defense intelligence agency he was <unk> by <unk> authorities for <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> a <unk> according to a u.s. <unk> cable from that period
the woman had nearly died
but u.s. intelligence rather than <unk> in or cut loose its new spy merely filed the report away
mr. noriega 's <unk> on emerging <unk> at his school were <unk> more important to u.s. interests
from that point on the u.s. would make a practice of <unk> the panamanian 's <unk>
the u.s. has <unk> and later turned against many <unk> but none quite so <unk>
the <unk> mr. noriega is n't as <unk> as the <unk> of iran as <unk> as nicaragua 's <unk> <unk> as imperial as <unk> <unk> of the <unk> or as <unk> as <unk> 's baby <unk> <unk>
yet he has proved more <unk> than any of them
and out of <unk> the u.s. can make <unk> and still hope to remove him from power but a single error on his part could cost him his life
the u.s. <unk> noriega all along says <unk> <unk> a former <unk> to panama
he has <unk> the art of <unk>
in keeping with america 's long history of <unk> up mr. noriega recent u.s. actions have extended rather than <unk> his <unk>
mr. noriega might have fallen of his own weight in N because of panama 's <unk> economic situation says mr. <unk> but increasing <unk> pressure has only given him additional <unk> for <unk> and a <unk> for his own <unk>
if the u.s. had sat back and done nothing he might not have made it through N mr. <unk> contends
perhaps most important mr. noriega 's allies have <unk> to encourage in some cases to demand that the dictator maintain his <unk> of the <unk>
one <unk> drug boss upon hearing in N that gen. noriega was negotiating with the u.s. to <unk> his <unk> for a comfortable <unk> sent him a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with his name
he is <unk> says the <unk> <unk> <unk> who has led <unk> church opposition against noriega
the americans have left him without a way out
it is easy to fight when you do n't have any other option
his chief advantage in the fight his intimate <unk> of american ways and <unk>
mr. noriega often tells friends that <unk> is the best <unk> against the <unk> who have a short attention <unk> and little <unk> for <unk> <unk>
the u.s. discovered the young <unk> noriega in late N when he was in his second year at the <unk> military academy in <unk> according to former u.s. intelligence officials
the <unk> occurred through mr. noriega 's <unk> a panamanian <unk> based in <unk> named <unk> carlos noriega <unk>
<unk> carlos <unk> that helping the americans could advance the career of any panamanian officer <unk> <unk> 's reports on the <unk> <unk> he <unk> among his fellow students and more important among his officers and <unk>
a spy was born
it was a <unk> experience for the <unk> and slightly built mr. noriega who was known to his friends as <unk> la <unk> <unk> face
born the <unk> son of his father 's <unk> he was raised on the mean streets of the central market district of panama city
<unk> was four years older than most of his fellow <unk> and gained <unk> to the academy because his <unk> had <unk> his <unk> <unk>
he considered himself <unk> <unk> to his <unk> <unk> many of whom were <unk> sons sent by their <unk> families to the highly <unk> <unk> academy as a sort of reform school
in his <unk> military cap and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> noriega felt more <unk> and powerful than ever in his <unk> life friends from the period say
he had an <unk> <unk> with gold <unk> in a country where there was a <unk> of <unk> where officers were the <unk> with special <unk> recalls <unk> <unk> a fellow student in <unk> and a <unk> friend
mr. noriega 's relationship to american intelligence agencies became <unk> in either N or N intelligence officials say
his <unk> officer at the <unk> <unk> <unk> major <unk> <unk> gave him an <unk> <unk> mr. noriega would <unk> the <unk> 's first intelligence service
the spy network would serve two clients the panamanian government by <unk> political opponents in the region and the u.s. by <unk> the growing communist influence in the unions organized at united fruit co. 's <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> and puerto <unk>
united fruit was one of the two largest <unk> to panama 's national income
<unk> its interests was a priority for any panamanian leader
mr. noriega 's initial <unk> was only $ N to $ N a month plus <unk> <unk> of liquor or <unk> from the american <unk> a former intelligence official says
it was modest pay by american standards but a healthy boost to his small military salary which fellow officers remember as having been $ N to $ N monthly
he did it very well recalls <unk> <unk> a former panamanian <unk> who managed mr. noriega and his operation
he started building the <unk> that helped him gain power
a national guard job assumed by <unk> noriega in N as chief of the <unk> police in david city capital of the <unk> <unk> was <unk> for an <unk> <unk>
by <unk> <unk> and bus drivers who needed licenses he gained a ready <unk> of information
he knew which local <unk> had been caught driving <unk> which had been found with their <unk>
this proved particularly valuable to the panamanian government in N when union leaders were planning a may day march that the government <unk> could turn <unk>
mr. noriega had learned that a local union leader was <unk> with the wife of his deputy
so he <unk> the information on <unk> that he distributed throughout the <unk> city of puerto <unk> which was ruled by united fruit co
the campaign so divided union leaders that the government found them far easier to control
it was like a play on <unk> recalls mr. <unk>
noriega managed the whole thing
he was <unk>
noriega was an expert at <unk> and <unk> people
during his years in <unk> however mr. noriega also <unk> himself as an officer as <unk> as he was <unk>
<unk> <unk> a local lawyer and <unk> monitor recalls an <unk> noriega <unk> <unk> in their cells at the <unk> <unk> <unk> headquarters in david where he had his offices
mr. noriega would order them all to take off their <unk> and run around the <unk> <unk> <unk> at them and then <unk> to his office
people started <unk> if something was wrong with him mr. <unk> recalls
but through this period so far as the u.s. military was concerned mr. noriega was a model <unk>
he signed up for intelligence and <unk> training under american officers at <unk> <unk> in panama in july N according to a <unk> of a N resume with details mr. noriega has since <unk> as secret
he <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> in september of that year for a course in <unk> operations returning to the school of the <unk> in panama for a <unk> course called military intelligence for officers
some american officers interpreted his <unk> and <unk> as a sign of loyalty but they did so <unk>
he rose to chief of intelligence in panama 's <unk> <unk> in N after providing <unk> dictator <unk> the critical support to <unk> a coup attempt against him a year earlier
he became gen. <unk> 's <unk> shadow and the holder of all panama 's <unk>
mr. noriega by now a <unk> <unk> expanded his <unk> to include the <unk> not to <unk> the <unk> the <unk> and any other intelligence service that came <unk>
when u.s. <unk> complained to the cia of <unk> noriega 's <unk> intelligence experts always <unk> that his <unk> was first to the americans
early on in the state department we took to calling him the <unk> in <unk> to his ability to <unk> milk the <unk> intelligence services of cuba and the united states recalls <unk> j. <unk> who as deputy assistant secretary of state for <unk> affairs first ran across reports about mr. noriega in N
some of us <unk> how our intelligence people could put so much stock in his information when he was just as close to the <unk>
even at this early stage drugs caused additional concerns
during the <unk> administration the drug enforcement administration became <unk> at the extent of the <unk> 's <unk> to <unk> drug <unk>
one <unk> agent drew up a list of five options for dealing with <unk> noriega one of which was assassination
the head of the <unk> at the time john ingersoll <unk> the assassination plan
but he did fly to panama to <unk> dictator <unk> on the drug ties of panamanian officials including mr. noriega
mr. ingersoll later <unk> that gen. <unk> seemed afraid to act on the concerns of the u.s.
everybody was afraid of him mr. ingersoll says
mr. noriega became an even greater threat in N when u.s. intelligence services discovered that he had been buying <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> from three <unk> working for the u.s. army 's <unk> military intelligence group
the <unk> included <unk> of gen. <unk> 's own phone according to american intelligence officials
we caught him with his hands on our <unk> <unk> says former cia director <unk> turner
for the first time the u.s. considered cutting mr. noriega from its intelligence payroll and the <unk> were intense mr. turner says
in the world of intelligence if you want to get information you get it from <unk> characters
the question is how much you get tied in with <unk> characters so they can <unk> you
intelligence officials to this day worry whether mr. noriega sold sensitive information on the <unk> to the <unk> or others
mr. turner was troubled enough to <unk> the u.s. contract with the <unk> at the beginning of the <unk> administration
the u.s. soon found new cause for concern <unk>
prosecutors in southern florida indicted five <unk> on charges of <unk> running arms to <unk> rebels trying to <unk> the <unk> government of mr. <unk>
they included one of mr. noriega 's <unk> friends and business partners carlos <unk>
and the investigators were quickly closing in on mr. noriega himself
at the time though in N the u.s. was once again <unk> with its longtime latin american spy
mr. noriega made plans to fly to washington for a meeting with his <unk> at the pentagon
<unk> county and federal authorities learning that he intended to fly through miami made plans to arrest him on the <unk> charges as soon as he hit u.s. <unk>
it was a friday in june
the pentagon <unk> the plan
according to military officers at the time word was passed to mr. noriega by his american <unk> that the police would be waiting
on monday u.s. officials received a <unk> <unk> message from the military group <unk> in panama
due to health reasons <unk> <unk> noriega has elected to <unk> his visit to washington it read
prosecutors in miami received yet another setback
their original indictment against mr. <unk> the friend of mr. noriega and the other four was dismissed on a <unk>
but now along with <unk> mr. noriega 's <unk> they intended to charge mr. noriega himself on allegations that he was involved in the illegal trading of some $ N million in arms
in january N <unk> sanford as assistant u.s. attorney was <unk> to a meeting with a federal bureau of investigation agent assigned to the bureau of <unk> tobacco and <unk> in miami
panamanian dictator <unk> he was told had <unk> the <unk> of iran <unk> in panama as a favor to washington
mr. sanford was told mr. noriega 's friend mr. <unk> would be handling the <unk> 's security
it would n't be a good idea to <unk> him much less mr. noriega the prosecutor was told

the inquiry also will cover the actions of charles keating jr. who is chairman of american continental corp. lincoln 's parent and who contributed heavily to several u.s. senators
mr. seidman told the committee that the resolution trust corp. the agency created to sell <unk> thrifts has <unk> lincoln 's <unk> reports by former regulators <unk> back to N
my staff indicated that had we made such findings in one of our own institutions we would have sought an immediate <unk> order to stop the <unk> operations mr. seidman said
when lincoln was <unk> by the government for example N N of its loans or $ N million were to <unk> who were buying real estate from one of american continental 's N other subsidiaries according to mr. seidman
but the government did n't step in until six months ago when thrift officials put lincoln into <unk> the day after american continental filed for chapter N bankruptcy protection from creditors
the bankruptcy filing the government has charged in a $ N billion civil lawsuit was part of a pattern to shift insured deposits to the parent company which used the deposits as a <unk> for real-estate deals
the deposits that have been transferred to other subsidiaries are now under the <unk> of the bankruptcy court
i think it 's fairly clear mr. keating knew that regulators were set to <unk> lincoln mr. seidman said
further investigation he said may result in further actions against lincoln 's executives said mr. seidman including fraud actions
mr. keating for his part has filed suit <unk> that regulators <unk> <unk> the thrift
<unk> <unk> an attorney in washington for mr. keating declined to comment on the hearings except to say we will be <unk> <unk> in several <unk> to each of these allegations at the appropriate time
lincoln 's treatment by former thrift regulators in an agency <unk> by the new law has proved <unk> for five senators who received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from mr. keating
mr. seidman said yesterday for example that sen. dennis <unk> d. ariz. who received $ N in contributions from mr. keating <unk> mr. seidman to request that he push for a sale of lincoln before it would be <unk>
after the government lawsuit was filed against lincoln sen. <unk> returned the campaign contributions
the senator 's spokesman said yesterday that he pushed for the sale of lincoln because hundreds of arizona jobs at lincoln were on the line
senate banking committee chairman donald <unk> d. <unk> has also returned contributions he received from mr. keating a year ago

house banking committee chairman henry gonzalez d. texas said sen. <unk> <unk> to appear before the house committee if necessary
but a committee staff member said the panel is unlikely to pursue closely the role of the senators
at the hearing mr. seidman said the <unk> has already <unk> $ N million into lincoln for liquidity
he also held out little hope of <unk> for <unk> of $ N million in american continental subordinated debt
some of those <unk> have filed a suit saying they believed they were buying <unk> certificates of deposit

eastern airlines ' creditors committee <unk> with the carrier 's plans for emerging from bankruptcy-law proceedings asked its own experts to <unk> <unk> approaches to a reorganization
representatives of the accounting firm of <unk> & young and the securities firm of goldman sachs & co. hired by creditors to <unk> on eastern 's financial plans told the committee in a private meeting yesterday that eastern 's latest plan to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection is far <unk> than an earlier one which won the creditors ' approval
according to one person present at the meeting eastern 's new plan is financially <unk> optimistic
asked about the consultants ' reports an eastern spokeswoman said we totally <unk>
she said they have <unk> and made some <unk> <unk> that make their analysis completely <unk>
at a later news conference here frank <unk> chairman of eastern 's parent texas air corp. said eastern was exceeding its goals for getting back into operation and predicted it would emerge from chapter N protection from creditors early next year operating with more service than it originally had scheduled
he <unk> as he has before that creditors would be paid in full under the plan
mr. <unk> made no <unk> of creditors ' negative response to his plan
we 're in the process of discussing an <unk> plan with the creditors and anticipate filing that <unk> plan shortly mr. <unk> told reporters
we 're meeting and <unk> our goals he added
in july eastern and its creditors agreed on a reorganization plan that called for eastern to sell $ N billion in assets and to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection at two-thirds its former size
but after selling off pieces such as its east coast shuttle its philadelphia <unk> and various planes eastern hit a <unk> block
it could n't sell its south american routes one of the major assets marked for <unk>
those routes valued by the creditors ' professionals at about $ N million were to be sold to amr corp. 's american airlines
a <unk> <unk> in negotiations with amr over an <unk> lawsuit between american and another texas air unit caused the deal to collapse
eastern ultimately decided it would have to keep and operate the routes itself which would leave it with less cash for its reorganization
it also would leave eastern a bigger carrier than the <unk> one proposed under the initial plan
those changes in its condition meant the reorganization plan previously presented to creditors would have to be <unk>
since then eastern has been negotiating with creditors over <unk> but the creditors committee has been having problems with the <unk>
the committee has two groups of experts it calls on to <unk> eastern 's plans
both said the new plan would n't work
<unk> & young said eastern 's plans will miss its projections of earnings before interest tax and <unk> by $ N million and that eastern 's plan presented no <unk> level according to a source present at yesterday 's session
experts from goldman sachs estimated eastern would miss the same mark by $ N million to $ N million the source said
the experts said they expected eastern would have to issue new debt to cover its costs and that it would generate far less cash than anticipated
other costs also would increase including maintenance because eastern has an older fleet
at the news conference mr. <unk> and eastern president <unk> <unk> presented a far <unk> assessment
<unk> by flight <unk> pilots and gate agents <unk> in <unk> new blue <unk> they said eastern has exceeded its operational goals and is <unk> its seats
starting next month eastern will begin flying N flights daily instead of the previously announced N they said
mr. <unk> declined to give out eastern 's daily losses but said he did n't expect eastern would have to <unk> into the cash from asset sales currently held in <unk>
these accounts hold several hundred million dollars primarily from asset sales
the plan eastern hopes to pursue he said calls for eastern to have $ N million in cash by year 's end
both he and mr. <unk> predicted that plan might be confirmed in january
as to negotiations with creditors mr. <unk> said in <unk> after the conference we 'll have to see how they talks come along
however he added it 's not a <unk> that the plan be accepted by creditors
it must be accepted by the court
under bankruptcy law eastern has exclusive rights for a certain period to develop its own reorganization plan
that deadline has been extended once and could be extended again
if eastern can get <unk> support court <unk> of its plan could be relatively <unk>
but creditors are free to press for court approval of their own plan or the court could <unk> both sides and draw its own
in any event some people familiar with the case question whether the court will act by january as forecast by mr. <unk> and mr. <unk>
eastern sought bankruptcy-law protection a few days after a <unk> strike began march N

but the bikes ' <unk> numbers safety concerns and fear that they damage <unk> <unk> have prompted <unk> from the <unk> to the eastern <unk> to ban them from the back country
key to the issue is that the bikes in <unk> hands can go virtually <unk> and in <unk> hands can become vehicles of <unk>
an <unk> <unk> can <unk> from a dead stop to the top of a <unk> table without losing balance
such <unk> allow <unk> to fly down <unk> mountain <unk> at <unk> of up to N miles an hour a <unk> for the <unk> but a <unk> for <unk> <unk> or <unk>
for <unk> <unk> managers across the nation the response is increasingly to shut the <unk>
the state of california following the lead of some regional <unk> recently adopted regulations that closed nearly all <unk> <unk> in state <unk> to mountain <unk>
the move largely <unk> them to roads used by <unk> vehicles
most other states have enacted similar <unk>
the bikes are <unk> on <unk> in national <unk>
even the u.s. forest service whose <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> vehicles on thousands of miles of its <unk> across the u.s. has begun to close some <unk> to the bikes including major <unk> of the popular pacific <unk> <unk> which <unk> from california to canada

yet <unk> 's <unk> stance has created something of a <unk> in the organization which estimates that N N of its N members own mountain bikes
pressure from these members prompted the club recently to <unk> its <unk> <unk> it no longer for example <unk> the bikes into the same category as <unk> and other <unk> <unk> vehicles

its margin fell only seven basis points or <unk> of a percentage point from a year ago compared with a <unk> drop at security pacific corp. and much larger declines among banks in other parts of the country
as a result wells fargo 's net interest income rose $ N million or N N to $ N million for the quarter

later that month it added an entire <unk> <unk> including N <unk> <unk> and more than N <unk> <unk> <unk> fighting vehicles
by september a new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with an additional N <unk> vehicles N more trucks and N <unk> <unk> troops had arrived in <unk>
in the last few weeks moscow has added <unk> <unk> the <unk> version of the <unk> <unk> <unk> aircraft <unk> which can <unk> <unk> 's <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> which can <unk> the <unk>
moscow claims this is all needed to protect the kabul regime against the <unk> resistance
it is well-known that the regular <unk> <unk> is filled with reluctant <unk>
but this is not the entire <unk> army and it is no longer kabul 's only military force
complete units have been <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and other east bloc nations N to N of these troops have returned
in addition the regime has established <unk> <unk> forces totaling more than N including N <unk> troops of the <unk> ministry <unk> which still is <unk> by N soviet <unk> officers
even if not all these forces are committed to the regime they are now <unk> on it
and thousands of <unk> children have been taken to the soviet union where they are <unk> for the behavior of their families
since N indian military advisers have been <unk> the kabul regime
in <unk> for the withdrawal moscow kabul and new <unk> signed two agreements for several hundred newly <unk> indian experts to replace some of the more visible soviet military personnel
cuban military personnel also have been active in <unk> since N
the soviets cut a deal with iran a future <unk> role in <unk> in exchange for <unk> support of soviet policy
the deal was <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> prime ministry
moreover serious questions have been raised about the claimed withdrawal of soviet forces
before his assassination in N president <unk> of <unk> <unk> stated that fresh soviet troops were being <unk> into <unk> even as others were <unk> <unk>
rep. bill <unk> r. fla. reports that these included N to N soviet central asian <unk> border <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> and wearing <unk> <unk>
meanwhile the kabul regime is increasingly successful at <unk> the resistance as <unk> <unk>
in this they are aided by years of american european <unk> and saudi support for the most <unk> <unk> radical <unk> <unk> with leaders whose policies are <unk> to the <unk> public
this heavy outside support for the worst has <unk> better moderate leaders
in <unk> last year for example the regime <unk> at <unk> was prepared to <unk> the city to resistance <unk>
at the last <unk> however <unk> officials sent in <unk> <unk> perhaps the most <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> with a demand that the <unk> be made to his forces
the deal fell through and <unk> remains a major regime base
the resistance <unk> not only air power <unk> and <unk> but often such <unk> as <unk> mine detectors or even winter <unk>
experienced resistance <unk> wanted to use <unk> action and <unk> <unk> to wear down the regime
instead they were <unk> by <unk> 's <unk> the channel for their support into <unk> <unk>
they took more than N N <unk> <unk> report that they faced <unk> without mine detectors
the wonder is not that the resistance has failed to <unk> the kabul regime but that it continues to exist and fight at all
last summer in response to congressional criticism the state department and the cia said they had <unk> military aid to the resistance months after it was cut off but it is not clear how much is being sent or when it will <unk>
for months the resistance has been <unk> against air attack
thus far there is no indication that they have been <unk> with <unk> or other <unk> weapons
indeed u.s. officials have indicated to the press that the <unk> of aid depends on what success the weakened resistance <unk> by the end of this year
moscow and kabul must have found that information <unk>
for a decade u.s. policy has been <unk> based on <unk> and the defense of <unk> and political <unk>
no settlement negotiated by others can force the <unk> people to give up their struggle
a <unk> of u.s. military aid would merely <unk> them to die in <unk>
<unk> of a new <unk> u.s. policy is long <unk>
ms. <unk> editor and <unk> of <unk> the great game <unk> freedom house <unk> the freedom house program on <unk> asia
nothing <unk> the <unk> of ronald reagan and his <unk> as much as the <unk> to aid nicaragua 's contra rebels or the <unk> of building a <unk> defense <unk> to <unk> out soviet nuclear <unk>
yet under mr. reagan 's preferred successor president bush those two <unk> <unk> causes are <unk> on the <unk>
and surprisingly little more than a <unk> of <unk> is being heard even though <unk> once <unk> fire supporting the contras and the strategic defense initiative
the programs have <unk> says rep. henry <unk> a conservative republican from illinois
yet he <unk> you look around and you say who are the leaders
who is going to carry the water
it is n't surprising that president bush has n't led a <unk> to <unk> up the contras or sdi
though he <unk> <unk> both programs mr. bush has n't been a <unk> champion of either cause as mr. reagan was
what 's surprising is that there is n't more of a conservative <unk> as the bush administration <unk> the programs <unk> down the <unk> list
a combination of factors a <unk> among some conservatives a decline in the <unk> of a soviet threat and a <unk> with other issues seem to explain the <unk> <unk>
above all though conservative republicans who have <unk> both the contras and sdi are reluctant to attack a republican president for failing to do more though that <unk> may be <unk>
we want to <unk> we want to say something about it and we 're going to as it gets worse says rep. <unk> <unk> an <unk> republican who has been a <unk> contra <unk>
but it 's like <unk> your father in the <unk>
you <unk> to do it because he 's your father
mr. <unk> says conservatives ' <unk> with mr. bush 's cautious handling of the recent unsuccessful coup in panama will make them more willing to speak out
of course neither president bush nor the congress has actually abandoned the contras or sdi
mr. bush has struck a deal with congressional leaders to provide <unk> aid to the contras until nicaragua holds national elections next february
but the administration has dropped any effort to win military aid for the rebels
and the administration 's deal with congress gives several congressional committees the right to cut off even <unk> aid next month though the committees are likely to let aid continue until february
most analysts think there 's little prospect the contras can be a significant fighting force without u.s. arms and after the february election their future in any form will be <unk> at best
instead of focusing on the contras mr. bush has <unk> to urging members of congress most recently in a white house meeting yesterday to approve financing for the election campaign of political opponents of nicaragua 's <unk> government
the administration continues to support sdi or star wars and it recently <unk> to persuade the senate to restore some of the funds it planned to cut from the program
and just last week defense secretary <unk> <unk> gave a strong speech <unk> <unk> reasons to push ahead with sdi and saying he 'd urge president bush to veto a defense bill with <unk> funding for the program
but the strong <unk> by mr. <unk> may be too little too late to prevent damage to sdi
the house has already voted for a deep cut in funding and in the end the program 's <unk> will be hard <unk> to head off some reduction in spending next year
and while the defense secretary is <unk> out president bush himself has n't launched any <unk> campaign to <unk> up support as president reagan did
the administration also acknowledges that it is n't pursuing mr. reagan 's original vision of an <unk> <unk> <unk> the whole u.s. but rather a more modest version
more <unk> to sdi supporters the bush administration appears to have <unk> accepted a new <unk> proposal from the soviet union that <unk> long-term trouble for star wars
the soviets have agreed to complete a treaty cutting strategic weapons without including restrictions on <unk> <unk>
but the soviets also are <unk> that they will reserve the right to <unk> from the completed <unk> treaty later on if the u.s. does sdi testing or <unk> that the soviets think <unk> the existing <unk> treaty
it will be hard down the road to persuade congress to approve money for sdi plans if lawmakers fear those plans could <unk> a completed treaty
as a result frank <unk> a former reagan pentagon aide who now heads the center for security policy charges that the administration 's <unk> of continued commitment to development and <unk> of the sdi program strain <unk>
still <unk> may be <unk> away from more <unk> because they sense political <unk> have turned against <unk> the <unk> rebels or boosting spending on sdi particularly when the public <unk> the soviet threat is declining under <unk> gorbachev
in fact because <unk> seems to be <unk> a global <unk> some conservatives may simply be so pleased that their <unk> <unk> is <unk> that they do n't have the fire at the moment to push controversial programs
the short of it is that the most <unk> among us can not get into too <unk> a mood with <unk> <unk> says mitchell <unk> a former reagan white house aide who now is president of the <unk> institute
some activists are <unk> to raise the <unk> of the two causes
but they say they ca n't make much <unk> because of a lack of willing leaders in a position to turn the <unk>
one longtime champion of these programs in congress republican <unk> <unk> <unk> of georgia is <unk> by questions about his ethics conservatives note
other conservative <unk> like <unk> republican sen. malcolm <unk> a longtime sdi <unk> do n't have the <unk> with the bush white house that they <unk> with president reagan
above all though <unk> say neither the contra nor the sdi cause can be pushed much further without more presidential support
for there to be wind in the <unk> of any program the chief executive has to be <unk> in the <unk> says rep. <unk>
all this causes rep. <unk> to <unk> about an <unk> way to <unk> up more <unk>
what i 'd like to see if he is up to it is for reagan to take to the <unk> to <unk> <unk> for sdi the congressman says
we 're <unk> to report that on monday president bush accepted the resignation of william allen as chairman of the u.s. civil rights commission
mr. allen appointed by president reagan grew <unk> <unk> of dealing with the <unk> <unk> of his <unk>
his recent speech <unk> <unk> blacks animals <unk> what is a minority caused an <unk> when its title <unk> out
mr. allen 's <unk> voted to call his <unk> speech <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
commissioner mary <unk> berry said it was another <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> who is chairman
rep. don <unk> the california democrat warned mr. allen that the speech would be outside the <unk> of the commission 's <unk>
thomas <unk> head of the <unk> legal defense fund called the prospect of the speech <unk> <unk>
we 've actually read the speech
mr. allen began it with a warning to his <unk> a california church group that <unk> rights for <unk>
he said that other participants in the conference do not believe that the rights of americans should be guaranteed to citizens who are <unk> but that i mean to persuade you to the <unk> view
he <unk> to the audience a <unk> <unk> <unk> he once heard <unk> now that we have finally <unk> that american blacks have rights we need to do the same for animals
mr. allen <unk> to this <unk> because it seems to <unk> the status of blacks to that of animals as a <unk> project of charity of <unk>
rights on such a basis whether for blacks or <unk> are <unk> <unk> he said subject to being taken back
he says the title of his speech was to make his point that americans have rights as individuals not as members of certain select groups
his speech criticized the <unk> of <unk> of protected groups in society as opposed to individual <unk> or as he put it in a common <unk> as americans
instead of lobbying for special treatment mr. allen said that <unk> and others should try to ensure equal treatment under the law and not aim for special <unk> that would risk <unk> <unk> with government <unk>
this hardly sounds like an <unk> <unk>
what 's really going on here
the three most important things to understand about mr. allen is that he is a black conservative <unk> a <unk> threat to the liberal <unk>
mr. allen who <unk> government at <unk> <unk> <unk> college in california and will remain a member of the commission has spent years <unk> that civil rights are individuals ' rights
he last made waves when he <unk> to defend an indian <unk> who had been adopted by <unk> parents off her <unk>
mr. allen quickly ran up against the liberal <unk> again which <unk> <unk> the <unk> concept of indian rights above the rights of individual <unk>
there is a huge <unk> between mr. allen 's <unk> view and the <unk> litigation approach of the civil rights groups
indeed the gap is so large that mr. allen 's critics <unk> to <unk> the debate
their <unk> of him is no <unk> for argument
their effort to run him out of washington is an <unk> to the original purpose of their own movement
we hope the next head of the civil rights commission will be as <unk> as mr. allen in making the case for <unk> of civil rights

polaroid corp. <unk> from <unk> savings reported a strong gain in third-quarter operating results and net income of $ N million or N cents a share after <unk> requirements
analysts said the numbers were better than expectations partly because of strong profit margins and a positive <unk> <unk>
however they said the company 's flat revenue was a <unk> and an indication that sales of polaroid 's new conventional film in the u.s. have been sluggish
revenue in the third quarter was $ N million almost unchanged from $ N million a year earlier
polaroid reported operating profit before taxes and interest costs of $ N million for the third quarter more than double the <unk> $ N million
charges for staff cuts and other restructuring produced a net loss of $ N million or N cents a share in N 's third quarter
i 'm somewhat skeptical about the underlying demand for polaroid products said michael <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> & co
if you believe that a good performance next year is <unk> on an <unk> of revenue there is n't a lot here to base <unk> on
alex <unk> an analyst with prudential-bache says polaroid officials told him yesterday that u.s. sales of the company 's new conventional film product introduced in the second quarter have been disappointing after a promising start

why is the stock market suddenly so volatile
yesterday the dow jones industrial average did a now familiar <unk> it plunged N points before lunch with most of the drop <unk> in N minutes
then it rebounded to <unk> down only N points
and those swings <unk> <unk> friday 's <unk> plunge and monday 's <unk> recovery
it 's <unk> that in an hour you can <unk> off so much value says <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> investment management corp. boston
and apparently it is here to stay
richard <unk> senior <unk> analyst at merrill lynch & co says my <unk> feel is that we 'll live with those swings for a while
there are many reasons for the market 's <unk> new trading vehicles such as stock-index futures and options <unk> strategies like program trading and crowd psychology
but most are linked by a single theme liquidity the ability to get in and out of the market quickly
prices are moving up and down so fast because investors are <unk> ways to turn over shares at <unk> rates and increasingly acting in <unk>
institutions are <unk> animals says peter anderson who heads the <unk> management arm of <unk> financial services inc
we watch the same <unk> and listen to the same <unk>
like <unk> we tend to move in the same direction at same time
and that naturally <unk> price movements
institutions who now account for most trading <unk> on being able to buy and sell big <unk> of stock at an <unk>
but when they <unk> that markets are n't always as liquid as they supposed markets jump
on monday for instance howard <unk> a principal at <unk> stevens & <unk> found that you could n't buy <unk> at quoted prices without paying up
and when many firms had to pay up monday 's sudden rally was <unk>
trading in futures and options some people believe can add to volatility
investors believe they can can rely on such derivative securities to get in and out of the stock market without actually selling any stocks that is a way of <unk> liquid even when they own stocks
these and other modern trading methods tend to promote dramatic <unk> in assets says george douglas first vice president at drexel burnham lambert inc
it 's the idea that what goes in easy can come out easy so that <unk> of higher volatility get built into the stock market
one new investment style called asset <unk> <unk> portfolio <unk> between stocks bonds and cash when computer models say one is more attractive
for instance first <unk> corp. an asset <unk> based in <unk> n.j. said it quickly boosted stock positions in its aggressive accounts to N N from N N to take advantage of <unk> prices friday
it added another N N monday before stocks rallied
when they did the firm reduced those stock holdings to about N N
a classic example of institutions ' <unk> for liquidity is portfolio insurance now widely <unk>
before the N crash an estimated $ N billion in institutional money was managed under this <unk> technique
the idea was to <unk> the value of a portfolio by selling futures when stock prices dropped eliminating the need to sell the stocks themselves
but in october N when portfolio insurers <unk> to sell at the same time they <unk> both the stock and futures markets
yet even today institutions are <unk> <unk> forms of portfolio insurance by <unk> <unk> to and <unk> in the markets
others are doing index arbitrage a strategy of taking advantage of price <unk> between stocks and futures
unlike traditional <unk> strategies all of the above require that market makers be on hand to provide liquidity by buying and selling stocks in a <unk>
but institutions say wall street brokerage firms are less willing to make markets
brokers do n't deny that
wall street traders say that with institutional brokerage commissions far lower than in the 1970s securities firms ca n't afford to take the risk of buying too much stock
i think everyone 's a little more <unk> says jack baker head of equity trading at <unk> lehman hutton inc
the institutions have driven commission rates down to the point where it makes no sense to <unk> capital says tom <unk> senior executive vice president in charge of institutional trading at oppenheimer & co
why should i risk money for a guy for who 's paying me five cents a <unk>
all you get is risk
lack of liquidity can also result from exchange reforms
many traders say that circuit <unk> put in place to <unk> volatility after the N crash actually added to volatility when the stock market plunged friday
the circuit <unk> caused a <unk> <unk> in trading in standard & poor 's 500-stock index futures contract as the markets were falling
with the <unk> halt you could only sell stocks to cut exposure to the market says a money manager
it was <unk> to people thinking that they could n't get their trades off
it was like they put you in a room with a <unk> and told you there were three <unk> to <unk> said one chicago-based futures trader
then they said by the way two of the <unk> are <unk>
the takeover <unk> also adds to volatility
ual corp. is a good example
valued as a buy-out target the airline stock was trading at nearly $ N a share
when the deal ran into trouble the stock tumbled it closed at $ N yesterday
<unk> ual is now trading closer to its value based on earnings
by contrast traditional <unk> investors are unlikely to generate sudden price moves
scott black a <unk> money manager who heads <unk> management inc. points out that for those who invest on fundamentals the value of a stock from day to day does n't change all that much
some experts say markets are n't as volatile as widely assumed
<unk> <unk> finance professor at <unk> university says the current volatility in u.s. markets <unk> in comparison to the <unk> decades before derivative instruments such as options and futures were introduced
i just ca n't believe that the <unk> in the financial market are causing any of this volatility he says
and robert d. <unk> president of asset <unk> first <unk> notes that before friday 's <unk> daily volatility on the new york stock exchange in recent weeks had reached <unk> low levels
some people tend to <unk> that a <unk> move is less in percentage terms than it was when the stock market was lower
john j. <unk> jr. chairman of the big board <unk> that N and N have been two of the least volatile years in the last N or N years
but the low average volatility mr. <unk> is talking about is n't any <unk> in a period of rapid stock-market moves like the past week
in addition sanford <unk> a <unk> school finance professor says volatile <unk> in stock prices will continue as long as liquidity falls short of the <unk> demands of institutions who can go out and say i have a billion dollars of stocks to sell
some people think the search for liquidity is <unk>
in N john maynard <unk> wrote that of the <unk> of <unk> finance none <unk> is more <unk> than the <unk> of liquidity
it leads investors to focus on short-term price movements a game of <unk> <unk> he called it rather than on long-term fundamental <unk>

the national <unk> and space administration said a computer virus has infected one of its networks and is <unk> <unk> <unk> related to its galileo space probe which is to be launched today
charles <unk> a nasa spokesman said the agency discovered the virus on monday on the collection of computer networks <unk> called <unk> and expected N university centers to be infected by today
although the network is n't connected to the computer systems that operate either galileo or the shuttle part of the network will carry <unk> of galileo data once the <unk> gets <unk>
mr. <unk> said the <unk> had n't yet done any <unk> but the agency <unk> <unk> data could be <unk> for real data
he estimated it could take a day for a computer security manager to <unk> the virus from a computer system
the <unk> among the <unk> yet to hit a research network appeared to affect only digital equipment corp. hardware that uses digital 's <unk> operating system
it is <unk> to the <unk> virus that last year infected <unk> a much larger network used by researchers at <unk> laboratories and government agencies around the world
in the <unk> of computer security the nasa <unk> is <unk> a computer worm mr. <unk> said
a worm <unk> in the operating system of a computer and <unk> by <unk> into other computers <unk> through networks
the galileo worm apparently was <unk> on a computer in france <unk> up to nasa 's space <unk> analysis network mr. <unk> said
nasa said the galileo worm had n't affected its computers or the computers of other government agencies because they had <unk> their systems to <unk> <unk>
but mr. <unk> said the worm hit <unk> that had n't elected to make the changes
michael <unk> a senior editor at <unk> a trade publication said he was told that the worm gets into a computer center by looking for obvious <unk> such as ones that are the same as the user 's name
if it finds one and gets into the system it will display a screen when a user <unk> on that says <unk> against nuclear <unk>
you talk of times of peace for all and then prepare for war
in addition mr. <unk> said the worm <unk> <unk> <unk> to other machines at the center such as george <unk> was an <unk> or do n't feed the <unk> <unk>
the worm also looks for <unk> <unk> that <unk> more <unk> on the user
the <unk> are included in the system software when it is installed but are supposed to be replaced as soon as the system is up and running
if it finds one of those <unk> mr. <unk> said the worm will do such things as change users ' <unk> to a series of <unk> numbers <unk> them from <unk> on to the network
nasa estimated that on monday about four computer centers were affected
yesterday the number grew to N today the number is expected to grow to N
nasa said it will take about a week before it knows exactly how many centers of the N connected to <unk> were affected and the extent of the damage if any
<unk> activists have <unk> the launch of the galileo space probe to <unk> because it uses <unk> to generate the electricity needed to run the <unk>
activists fear that if the shuttle carrying galileo into <unk> should <unk> or if galileo itself <unk> into the earth during the two times it <unk> close to the planet <unk> levels of <unk> would be released into the atmosphere
so far galileo has been delayed twice once because of a computer <unk> connected with a <unk> engine and yesterday because of the weather
nasa said the galileo worm had nothing to do with either delay
mr. <unk> of <unk> said <unk> have gone after <unk> before
he said the <unk> computer club of west germany once managed to <unk> <unk> and do such things as change the value of <unk> <unk> up some calculations
it is now a <unk> that prosecutors are bringing criminal <unk> in cases where until a few years ago only a civil action at most would have been brought
yet it is also <unk> that the power to create new <unk> <unk> only to the legislature and not to courts
beginning in the early <unk> century with u.s. v. <unk> and <unk> the supreme court has <unk> held that a judicial power to <unk> conduct to be against the public interest and <unk> criminal while well established in british law would <unk> legislative authority under the <unk> of <unk> of powers
that 's the conventional theory anyway
in practice however the line between <unk> and <unk> of the criminal law long ago began to <unk>
in particular a common law of <unk> crime has developed with surprising <unk> over the past decade
for example although insider trading has long been criminal it has never been <unk> defined
in N the supreme court tried to supply a <unk> definition in the <unk> v. sec decision which found that liability <unk> on whether the <unk> had <unk> his <unk> duty to the corporation in order to obtain some personal gain and whether the <unk> knew or <unk> <unk> this fact
<unk> however lower courts and prosecutors have pushed this definition to its breaking point
consider the facts underlying the N conviction of robert <unk>
prior to a tender offer by <unk> for <unk> inc. in N the founder of the <unk> 's <unk> chain called an elderly relative to tell her to <unk> her stock certificates for delivery
she called her <unk> to take her to the bank who in turn <unk> her husband a mr. <unk> to run this <unk>
hearing of this information the husband discussed it with his broker mr. <unk> and mr. <unk> then bought for his own account and other clients
<unk> mr. <unk> was a <unk> <unk>
did mr. <unk> his <unk> <unk> a <unk> duty and if so to whom
did mr. <unk> seek personal gain and if so how
or did mr. <unk> only hear a market <unk> which one may <unk> trade upon
the line seems <unk> thin for <unk> purposes
a second <unk> is <unk> by the recent guilty plea entered by robert freeman formerly head of arbitrage at goldman sachs & co
essentially mr. freeman had invested heavily in the <unk> leveraged buy-out when he was told by another <unk> trader bernard <unk> <unk> that the deal was in trouble
after <unk> orders to sell mr. freeman called martin <unk> an investment banker at kidder peabody & co. who was advising on the deal to <unk> these rumors
mr. <unk> asked mr. freeman who his source was and on hearing that it was <unk> <unk> responded well your <unk> has a good <unk>
the illegal <unk> of the <unk> 's good <unk> was then largely a <unk> of rumors already known to many in the market
had the case gone to trial the same issues would have <unk>
was there a <unk> <unk> in order to obtain personal gain
did mr. freeman have notice of this
finally was the information material
yet all these issues are subsidiary to a more central issue who is and who should be making the criminal law here
it is not my <unk> that either mr. <unk> or mr. freeman was an <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
<unk> both were on notice that their behavior was at least risky
but even if they <unk> <unk> reasons still exist to fear and <unk> this steady process of <unk> judicial <unk> of the law of insider trading
courts and <unk> make decisions in very different ways and are each <unk> to very different kinds of <unk>

when a court <unk> that a particular <unk> 's conduct was <unk> and so <unk> the definition of insider trading to reach this conduct it does not see the potentially enormous number of other cases that will be covered by the expanded rule
thus a court is poorly <unk> to make <unk> about the social utility of the expanded rule

conservatives have an important decision to make this fall
at the recent meetings of the world bank and international monetary fund the bush administration announced its <unk> to decide by <unk> the size of the next increase in the imf 's capital base
while the u.s. share of the increase probably will not reach the $ N billion or more <unk> in the imf 's request for a doubling of its $ N billion capital the administration probably will agree to a <unk> increase
this would be <unk> with its <unk> support for the brady plan and <unk> <unk> <unk> and with its financial commitment to mexico poland and others
the imf has several reasons for <unk> the increase
its role in the <unk> of developing countries has grown steadily since the 1970s
the size and pace of <unk> will <unk> further under the brady plan which promises larger and earlier <unk> to approved countries
at least three other factors have encouraged the imf to insist on increased capital
first it <unk> that its capital base must be increased in order to maintain its size relative to world financial markets for which it <unk> some responsibility
second the world bank 's recent $ N billion capital increase $ N billion from the u.s. has left the imf feeling less than first <unk> among international financial institutions
third the imf would like to meet japan 's request for increased ownership currently N N
japan has supported a larger role for the imf in <unk> debt issues and is an important financial <unk> for <unk> programs in developing countries
while international politics may argue for the capital increase there is a clear economic case against it
opponents of the increase argue that the imf practices central planning while supporting <unk> governments
they question whether the imf has any role in developing countries given its original <unk> to assist industrial countries in <unk> <unk>
opponents show that there are already more funds available than <unk> reform efforts
they worry that new imf funding of developing countries will simply end up <unk> imf debt for <unk> commercial bank debt a bad trade all around
they believe <unk> which <unk> the problems of markets investment climate and management practices is the key to <unk> growth not the imf 's <unk> focus on trade <unk> quarterly targets and government debt
they point at the numerous <unk> governments that have <unk> <unk> and <unk> themselves into <unk> under <unk> imf programs
decisions on increases in the imf 's capital base traditionally are made by the administration with subsequent <unk> by congress
the last u.s. congressional <unk> in N was a political <unk> and carried a $ N billion housing program along with it to secure adequate votes
the politics of the N congressional <unk> are likely to be similar to those of previous <unk>
<unk> may support the <unk> <unk> role of the imf on two conditions that the administration give assurances that liberal democrats ' support will not be used against them in congressional <unk> campaigns and that the legislation address with dollars social and environmental concerns
conservative republicans will be given the choice of supporting or fighting their party 's popular president in an election year
a u.s. decision to <unk> the imf its capital increase or limit it to N N would bring a major change in international economic policy and could not be taken <unk>
<unk> would <unk> over the implications for the <unk> <unk> process and the <unk> of world financial markets
because commercial banks and the <unk> governments believe they will get a piece of any capital increase a <unk> imf mission would leave both feeling <unk>
<unk> a u.s. rejection of the capital increase and transfer of shares to japan would give japan an argument against future calls for economic <unk>
on the other hand a decision to increase the imf 's capital would <unk> the central economic role of <unk> institutions in developing countries
with the increase even more <unk> energy and <unk> would be <unk> from creating profitable economic systems to setting up economic planning <unk> that generate <unk> economic plans
<unk> the <unk> could slow economic development even further as countries delay <unk> steps in anticipation of <unk> <unk> support
conservatives should take a position prior to the administration 's year-end deadline
the issues are too important to be left to the financial and budget <unk> fighting over the size of the capital increase rather than its purpose
if conservatives do n't support an increase in the imf 's capital then it is <unk> on them to speak up now and explain the alternative
