currently in the middle of a <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> mr. glass has left behind his <unk> equipment and <unk> in favor of going it alone
he <unk> down at the <unk> and plays
and plays
either one <unk> it or one does n't
the typical glass audience which is more likely to be <unk> of music students than their teachers certainly does
the work though sounds like <unk> for <unk>
philip glass is the <unk> and his music the new <unk> of the <unk>
his success is easy to understand
<unk> <unk> and <unk> his pieces mr. glass looks and sounds more like a <unk> <unk> <unk> his work than a <unk> <unk> playing a <unk>
the <unk> <unk> which have been <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> cyclical <unk> and <unk> are <unk> <unk> therefore <unk> <unk> <unk> therefore <unk> and <unk> <unk> but <unk> therefore both pretty and <unk>
it is music for people who want to hear something different but do n't want to work especially hard at the task
it is <unk> <unk> for the now generation
mr. glass has <unk> the famous <unk> <unk> less is more
his more is always less
far from being <unk> the music <unk> <unk> us with apparent <unk> not so <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of N time <unk> <unk> and <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>
but the music has its <unk> and mr. glass has <unk> his <unk> program around a move from the simple to the relatively complex
opening N from <unk> <unk> the audience to the glass technique never <unk> too far from the <unk> 's center mr. glass works in the two <unk> on either side of middle c and his <unk> <unk> leave the <unk>
there is a <unk> <unk> style here but not a particular performance style
the music is not especially <unk> indeed it 's hard to <unk> a bad performance of it
nothing <unk> no <unk> no <unk> <unk> problems challenge the <unk>
we hear we may think <unk> <unk> but they all seem to be saying the same thing
with planet news music meant to <unk> <unk> of allen <unk> 's <unk> <unk> <unk> mr. glass gets going
his hands sit <unk> apart on the <unk>
<unk> <unk> make you feel as though he may break into a very slow <unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> but there is little <unk> even though his <unk> begin to <unk> over more of the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> first the music is <unk> then it becomes soft then you realize it becomes <unk> again
the fourth <unk> play an <unk> from <unk> on the beach is like a <unk> but it does n't seem to move much beyond its <unk> ground in three <unk> <unk>

he does this in at least three of his <unk> pieces
you might call it a <unk> or a <unk> <unk>

not only is the typical <unk> <unk> it is also often <unk> in its <unk> s

later it was performed on radio <unk> in germany and then <unk> <unk> took it for one of her <unk> pieces
the point is that any piece can be used as <unk> music for virtually anything
the evening ended with mr. glass 's <unk> another <unk> work
parts N N and N come from the <unk> of <unk> morris 's <unk> film the thin blue line and the two other parts from <unk> music to two separate <unk> of the <unk> story of the same name
when used as <unk> in this way the music has an appropriate <unk> as when a <unk> <unk> a <unk> minor third <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> of reports <unk> and <unk> of witnesses in the morris film
served up as a <unk> however the music <unk> the <unk> provided by a <unk> within another <unk>
<unk> of mr. glass may agree with the <unk> richard <unk> 's sense that the N music in <unk> parts is as <unk> and <unk> as the <unk> <unk>
but while making the obvious point that both <unk> develop <unk> from <unk> this comparison <unk> the <unk> <unk> nature of mr. glass 's music
its <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> that makes one <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> <unk> the <unk> radical <unk> of <unk> and <unk> and what in <unk> even seems like <unk> in <unk>

a N N stake would allow <unk> to include <unk> earnings in its results

yesterday a spokeswoman said the company was pleased with our progress in that <unk> and hopes to provide additional details soon
<unk> said its defense and <unk> systems group <unk> delays in shipping some <unk> contracts during the third quarter resulting in lower operating profit for that business
overall <unk> reported earnings of $ N million or $ N a share for the three months ended oct. N compared with a loss of $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier

whatever may be the problems with this system it <unk> reflects <unk> risk or <unk> <unk>
perhaps mr. <unk> was <unk> by congress 's <unk> statement of the national goal in section N which indeed calls for the <unk> of <unk> by N no less
this <unk> statement was not taken seriously when enacted in N and should not now be <unk> with the <unk> provisions of the <unk>
thus you do the public a great <unk> when mr. <unk> suggests even <unk> that the clean water act <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> and water your <unk> readers may be led to believe that nothing but chance or <unk> <unk> them as they <unk> in the night with their <unk> and <unk> from the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> club at their <unk>
robert j. <unk>
national <unk> the <unk> u.s. magazine is <unk> more readers than ever and offers the <unk> <unk> pages that <unk> advertisers love
so why did advertising pages plunge by almost N N and ad revenue by N N in the first half
to hear advertisers tell it the magazine just has n't kept up with the times
despite renewed interest by the public in such <unk> as the environment and the third world it has n't been able to <unk> its reputation as a magazine <unk> like to <unk> through in search of <unk> <unk> women
worse it <unk> behind competitors in offering <unk> <unk> from regional <unk> to <unk> for <unk> advertisers
but now the magazine is attempting to fight back with an ambitious plan including a <unk> sales strategy and a surprisingly aggressive ad campaign
advertisers do n't think of the magazine first says <unk> <unk> who joined in april as national advertising director
what we want to do is take a more aggressive stance
people did n't believe we were in <unk> with the <unk> and in many ways we were n't
the <unk> magazine has never had to <unk> advertisers with quite so much <unk> before
it largely <unk> on its <unk> <unk> N million subscribers in the first half up from N million a year ago an average age of N for readers at the <unk> of their <unk> years loyalty to the <unk> of an N N average <unk> <unk> rate
the magazine had its best year yet in N when it <unk> its <unk> and <unk> up a N N gain in ad pages to N
but this year when the <unk> surrounding its <unk> died so too did some <unk> interest
the reason ad executives say is that the entire magazine business has been soft and national <unk> has some <unk> that make it especially <unk> during a soft market
perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices $ N for a <unk> page vs. $ N for the <unk> a comparable publication with a far smaller circulation
when ad dollars are tight the high page cost is a major <unk> for advertisers who generally want to appear <unk> in a publication or not at all
even though national <unk> offers far more readers than does a magazine like <unk> the page costs you an arm and a <unk> to develop any <unk> says harry glass new york media manager for <unk> inc
to <unk> that problem national <unk> like other magazines began offering regional <unk> allowing advertisers to appear in only a portion of its magazines for example ads can run only in the magazines sent to subscribers in the largest N markets
but the magazine was slower than its competitors to come up with its regional <unk> and until last year offered fewer of them than did competitors
time magazine for example has more than N separate <unk> going to different <unk> top management and other groups
another <unk> point for advertisers was national <unk> 's <unk> of <unk> its ads together usually at the beginning or end of the magazine rather than <unk> ads out among its articles as most magazines do
and national <unk> 's <unk> size means extra production costs for advertisers
but ms. <unk> says the magazine is fighting back
it now offers N regional <unk> it very recently began running ads <unk> to articles and it has been <unk> up its sales force
and it just launched a promotional campaign to tell chief executives marketing directors and media executives just that
the <unk> of the promotion is its new ad campaign into which the magazine will <unk> about $ N mostly in the next few weeks
the campaign created by <unk> group 's <unk> <unk> agency takes advantage of the <unk> <unk> that national <unk> is known for
in one ad a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> in paris is <unk> with the <unk> the only book more <unk> than <unk> does n't accept advertising
another ad pictures a <unk> <unk> <unk> N times with the <unk> for impact far beyond your size consider our regional <unk>
ms. <unk> says she wants the campaign to help attract advertisers in N categories including corporate financial services consumer electronics insurance and food
her goal to top N ad pages in N up from about N this year
whether she can meet that ambitious goal is still far from certain
the ad campaign is meant to <unk> the thought of national <unk> she says
we want it to be a <unk> kind of image
wcrs plans <unk> sale

the commodity futures trading commission plans to restrict <unk> trading on commodity exchanges a move almost certain to <unk> exchange officials and traders
the <unk> said it will <unk> the restrictions after the release of a study that shows little economic benefit resulting from <unk> trading and <unk> problems associated with the practice
<unk> trading gives an exchange trader the right to trade both for his own account and for customers
the issue <unk> this year after a federal bureau of investigation operation led to charges of widespread trading <unk> at the chicago board of trade and chicago mercantile exchange
while not specifically mentioned in the fbi charges <unk> trading became a focus of attempts to <unk> industry regulations
critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders ' customer orders
traders are likely to oppose such restrictions because <unk> trading provides a way to make money in slower markets where there is a shortage of customer orders
the exchanges contend that <unk> trading <unk> liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they do n't have a customer order in hand
the exchanges say liquidity becomes a severe problem for <unk> traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration
the <unk> may take those <unk> into account by allowing <unk> to its restrictions
the agency did n't <unk> specific <unk> where <unk> trading might be allowed but smaller exchanges or contracts that need additional liquidity are expected to be among them
<unk> <unk> the agency 's chairman told the senate agriculture committee that she expects the study to be released within two weeks and the rule changes to be completed by <unk>
the study by the <unk> 's division of economic analysis shows that a trade is a trade a member of the study team said
whether a trade is done on a <unk> or <unk> basis the member said does n't seem to have much economic impact
currently most traders on commodity exchanges <unk> in trading either for customer accounts which makes them brokers or for their own accounts as <unk> <unk>
the tests indicate that <unk> and <unk> traders are similar in terms of the trade <unk> and liquidity they provide to the market mrs. <unk> told the senate panel
members of congress have proposed <unk> <unk> trading in bills to <unk> <unk> operations
the house 's bill would <unk> <unk> trading in markets with daily average volume of N contracts or more <unk> those considered too difficult to track without a sophisticated computer system
the senate bill would force the <unk> to <unk> <unk> trading if an exchange ca n't show that its <unk> system can <unk> <unk> <unk>
so far one test of <unk> <unk> trading has worked well
the chicago <unk> <unk> <unk> trading in its standard & poor 's 500-stock index futures <unk> in N
under the rules traders decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for customers
traders who stand on the <unk> 's top step where most customer orders are <unk> ca n't trade for themselves
a <unk> spokesman said the plan has n't made much difference in liquidity in the <unk>
it 's too soon to tell but people do n't seem to be <unk> with it he said
he said he would n't comment on the <unk> plan until the exchange has seen the full proposal
but at a meeting last week tom <unk> the board of trade 's president told commodity lawyers <unk> trading is <unk> worth <unk>
it adds something to the market
japanese firms push <unk> car <unk>

but only two-thirds of <unk> dealers are <unk> new buildings according to the <unk> <unk>
some are even coming up with their own novel designs
in louisville ky. for example david peterson has built a <unk> <unk> with the <unk> on the second floor
yet some dealers have turned down <unk> or <unk> <unk> because they were <unk> or unable to meet the design requirements
lee seidman of cleveland says <unk> was a bear on <unk> but at least let him <unk> an existing building without the <unk>

<unk> by patent protection from following suit <unk> decided to go a step further and cut the <unk> in half again down to the <unk> of a <unk>
by N <unk> and engineers at <unk> a <unk> <unk> subsidiary had produced a working model of a <unk> <unk>
by N however the patent status of the <unk> <unk> had changed <unk> <unk> to develop its own competitive <unk> system which it did
marketing and sales departments then urged <unk> of the <unk> project
but others said <unk> should proceed
both were right
<unk> went ahead and introduced the <unk> in N but it has n't sold well
to date says <unk> <unk> a <unk> vice president it has broken even or shown a small loss
nevertheless the device has been successful in other ways
it helped <unk> attract better engineers and it provided new technology for other company products
the <unk> <unk> also helped <unk> the company 's reputation from <unk> to <unk> <unk>
it gave me great pride to see the <unk> of the <unk> in japan look at the <unk> and <unk> his head and say <unk> says mr. <unk>
<unk> 's <unk> <unk> is one of N case studies in the <unk> design project <unk> by the design management institute of boston and harvard business school

a <unk> 's progress means <unk> out
one day <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> was <unk> some <unk> leaves but the <unk> kept <unk> up over the <unk>
the harder he tried to push them into large <unk> the closer he came to breaking the <unk> and <unk> his back
so mr. <unk> then vice president of the <unk> <unk> association took a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> it to the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> about nine <unk> up
his crude device worked the lower <unk> <unk> the leaves into a <unk> while the higher harder <unk> moved the top of the <unk>
now <unk> into a <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> or <unk> also are supposed to aid in <unk> up leaves

in N <unk> and the german navy threatened to attack the panama <unk> so we created the southern <unk> in panama
the southern <unk> has grown even bigger since the war because <unk> 's <unk> sometimes runs through the <unk> <unk> <unk> like gen. noriega

so far no one has
the <unk> of the soviet <unk> discovered in cuba back in the <unk> costs just a few hundred million the price of the <unk> <unk> in key west that president <unk> created in N
the <unk> has n't been heard from since but we keep the staff around just in case
george marshall 's <unk> is much more difficult to keep happy
we keep a lot of <unk> to him around the pentagon <unk> <unk> <unk> and such
the army headquarters on the third <unk> of the pentagon used to <unk> a lot of <unk> to him but the navy headquarters on the fourth <unk> made them stop it
you see marshall had this thing about the navy and the <unk> he wanted to make them part of the army but secretary of the navy james <unk> <unk> him
now his <unk> wo n't let up <unk> it 's done
to keep him quiet we <unk> a new <unk> <unk> every year or so run by the army or the air force and put more of the navy and <unk> under it
but we still hear him <unk> at night because the navy has a few ships left and to <unk> him the navy 's sea <unk> forces were given to a new air force <unk> in illinois its space operations to another <unk> in colorado the <unk> to a new army <unk> in <unk> <unk> and the navy 's indian ocean and <unk> gulf forces to an army <unk> in florida
which <unk> up the worst and <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> of the <unk> of iran
when the <unk> died president <unk> was so <unk> that the <unk> 's <unk> would blame him for <unk> him out to make way for the <unk> that he declared the <unk> <unk>
mr. <unk> said he would go to war to stop anyone from trying to <unk> iran
but that <unk> would n't settle for words he wanted money and people lots
so mr. <unk> formed three new army divisions and gave them to a new <unk> in <unk> called the rapid <unk> force
but that <unk> was n't <unk> he knew the <unk> was neither rapid nor <unk> nor a force even though it cost $ N billion or $ N billion a year
after mr. <unk> was <unk> in N the <unk> 's <unk> claimed the credit and then went after president reagan and cap <unk>
i saw what he did to them <unk>
it made my <unk> <unk> with <unk>
why he used to lay in wait for cap suddenly he 'd <unk> from behind some <unk> of marshall onto cap 's <unk> and <unk> him by the <unk> and <unk> him <unk> he <unk> up an additional $ N billion or so
cap added four more divisions to the army two active and two reserve two carrier groups to the navy a division equivalent to the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and a thousand <unk> aircraft to the air force
he bought $ N billion in <unk> ships and $ N billion in <unk> and equipment to fill them and <unk> them at a new $ N billion base at diego garcia in the middle of the indian ocean
he <unk> all these new forces to the <unk> gulf
one night both marshall 's <unk> and the <unk> 's <unk> together caught cap and <unk> him to the ground
before they let him go he added a thousand bureaucrats to the <unk> in <unk> and <unk> it central <unk>
he gave those bureaucrats charge of all <unk> operations in the <unk> gulf and indian ocean
marshall figured it would be good training for those <unk> <unk> maybe they would get the whole navy
they had <unk> moving the carriers around but it turned out that they had <unk> all about mine <unk>
but the <unk> still kept <unk> out at cap so cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and $ N billion of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in order that those seven new army divisions and three <unk> <unk> could <unk> from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the <unk> <unk>
then suddenly <unk> 's <unk> came to visit and said what the <unk> are you doing planning for a land war in asia N miles away
we 'd get our <unk> <unk>
lucky for cap <unk> was <unk> and soon went away while the <unk> he kept coming back
so the u.s. found itself paying about $ N billion in <unk> to various arab <unk> for <unk> rights around the indian ocean
we had great success in <unk>
but then it turned out that president <unk> <unk> was not at all a <unk> person and the navy pointed out that the base he promised us in <unk> had <unk> up about a hundred years ago and anyway was N miles from the <unk> of the gulf
but who 's <unk>
still <unk> was the best we could get so we stay in <unk> with president <unk>
all these reports about him <unk> <unk> are probably <unk> anyway
but would n't you know now that we are spending <unk> of dollars and have built those new divisions and new air <unk> and have <unk> all these ships and supplies to fight the <unk> in iran the <unk> seem to have lost interest in the whole subject
meanwhile congress is cutting huge <unk> out of the rest of the defense budget
<unk> some navy guys said do we still need to keep all N army divisions on active duty and all those extra <unk> aircraft without <unk> and all those army guys playing <unk> in <unk>
could n't we save $ N billion or $ N billion a year by <unk> that stuff to the reserves
and why not save the costs of a thousand bureaucrats by <unk> central <unk> and putting responsibility for gulf <unk> operations back where it <unk> <unk> with the task force <unk> in the gulf
and where were all our <unk> paid indian ocean allies last year when our <unk> were being <unk>
questions like that really <unk> up marshall 's <unk>
he appeared late one night in the <unk> of the new defense secretary <unk> <unk>
marshall came <unk> in like <unk> 's <unk> <unk> those chains of <unk> and air <unk> and <unk> with arab <unk>
he would n't leave until mr. <unk> promised to do whatever the pentagon systems analysts told him
so next day mr. <unk> went out and did just that he canceled the <unk> navy and cut back one carrier and N <unk>
then he canceled production of the navy 's most important carrier aircraft the <unk> and the <unk>
on the other hand mr. <unk> retained all those new land forces
marshall 's <unk> is <unk> for now but he 'll be back
what with <unk> coming and bigger defense cuts <unk> more and more pentagon bureaucrats are <unk> under their <unk>
they know that they can hold off the <unk> only a little while longer by cutting carriers and ships
then the whole thing will start to collapse just as it did in the 1970s and the <unk> and <unk> will be <unk> through the place turning people 's <unk> white
gives me the <unk> just thinking about it
mr. lehman a reagan navy secretary is a managing director of painewebber
the metal and <unk> <unk> of <unk> bank 's headquarters is <unk> than your average savings and loan
for one thing there is an old <unk> on the wall samuel <unk> david a big <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>
at the moment however the <unk> is a <unk> <unk> of the problems that have <unk> <unk> and its <unk> chairman and chief executive david l. paul
in an international buying <unk> that began barely two years ago mr. paul <unk> a collection of about N <unk> works including the <unk> at a total cost of $ N million
by <unk> oct. N all of the <unk> were supposed to have been sold off under orders from florida 's comptroller whose office <unk> the state 's <unk>
<unk> did n't meet the deadline
the collection was at the heart of a <unk> plan mr. paul had in which the art was to do double duty as an investment for <unk> and as <unk> for the s&l 's new office tower designed by <unk> <unk>
the <unk> is that the $ N million was <unk> from the funds of this federally insured institution even as <unk> was losing money hand over <unk>
mr. paul had no right to buy art for the s&l in the first place it is n't on the comptroller 's <unk> list without seeking a special <unk> which he did not do
besides that some of the <unk> that were to <unk> the walls of <unk> actually ended up <unk> in the chairman 's estate on la <unk> <unk> off miami beach
last spring the comptroller 's office called a halt to mr. paul 's <unk> giving him six months to sell the <unk>
the acquisitions officials said in a letter to mr. paul were <unk> <unk> and <unk>
so far mr. paul has <unk> but three of his <unk> he wo n't say to whom
the comptroller 's office says it is <unk> the situation
though the agency could remove mr. paul it has no current <unk> to do that
it 's not like selling <unk> mr. paul says as he takes a <unk> on a <unk> st. <unk> cigarette
the last six months has established the quality of the collection
there 's no fire sale here
despite mr. paul 's <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> is finding that getting <unk> florida 's largest thrift institution out of its <unk> investments is much tougher than getting into them had been
<unk> are just part of the picture
although mr. paul has <unk> a $ N billion junk-bond portfolio to less than $ N million since april the high-yield debt market has plummeted
<unk> itself of what is left as is required of all thrift institutions by july N under the new federal s&l bailout law may well prove difficult
and <unk> has other problems
late last week federal regulators ordered the thrift institution to stop paying dividends on its preferred stock a move that suggests deep concern about an institution
mr. paul has a plan to bring in $ N million by selling off N of <unk> 's N branches but it has yet to be approved by regulators
it is mr. paul 's art venture however that has <unk> the most attention from investors and regulators not to <unk> <unk> throughout the world
<unk> shareholders some of whom are <unk> say the chairman and his collection <unk> the <unk> of speculation that set off the national s&l crisis
<unk> shares have fallen sharply in price from a high of $ N in N to close yesterday at $ N
<unk> directors meanwhile say mr. paul and others of his <unk> have left an <unk> mark on the art world and not for the better
<unk> do n't say it 's a van <unk> <unk> <unk> harry <unk> the president of <unk> & co. a new york <unk>
they say <unk> <unk> got $ N million for his so certainly $ N million is n't too much for mine
the great <unk> we <unk> on such as paul <unk> or <unk> <unk> have stopped buying and the new buyers are <unk> men who made money in the stock market or in takeovers and <unk> into <unk>
mr. <unk> an art dealer and <unk> sold <unk> van <unk> 's <unk> at a sotheby 's auction in november N to australian businessman alan bond
trouble is mr. bond has yet to pay up and until he does sotheby 's has the <unk> under <unk> and key
when mr. paul moved in on the art market he let it be known that virtually no piece was too costly to be considered by <unk>
he established his reputation as a <unk> in january last year at sotheby 's auction of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> collection in new york
there on one of his first shopping <unk> mr. paul picked up several <unk> at <unk> prices
he paid $ N million for instance for a still life by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that was expected to <unk> perhaps $ N
the price paid was a record for the <unk>
some N N of items offered at the <unk> auction were sold at an average price of $ N
the rest were <unk> for lack of <unk> bids
<unk> mr. paul is said by mr. <unk> to have <unk> mr. <unk> the new york developer selling the collection and <unk>
he says he <unk> them recalls mr. <unk>
and he tells me if you want to see your <unk> you 'll have to come to my house in florida
mr. paul <unk> <unk> and <unk>
it 's just not true he says
mr. paul quickly became more aggressive in his <unk> with the help of george <unk> a sotheby 's expert in old <unk> whom he met at an <unk> of the <unk> items
mr. <unk> who became his principal adviser <unk> <unk> in london paris and <unk>
and according to one dealer mr. <unk> had a <unk> for <unk> mr. paul with the <unk> he can buy anything
<unk> hall the president of the <unk> <unk> ltd. <unk> in new york sold mr. paul <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk>
mr. hall says mr. paul was known to spend a lot of money
people were interested in seeing him but it was <unk> that the <unk> was through sotheby 's and particularly george <unk>
mr. paul thus developed a close <unk> relationship with sotheby 's
mr. paul was eager to <unk> a collection for the headquarters <unk> has been moving into for the greater part of a year
sotheby 's the auction house founded in london N and now under the <unk> of sotheby 's holdings inc. was hoping to <unk> up interest in old <unk> as it <unk> to build its u.s. business
european dealers continued to <unk> the action in old <unk> which sotheby 's north america had <unk> been <unk> in this country
for several months there was <unk> all around
last october mr. paul paid out $ N million of <unk> 's cash plus a $ N million commission for <unk> of a man as <unk>
the <unk> attributed to <unk> <unk> peter paul <unk> was purchased privately through sotheby 's not at auction
in march N just N months into his campaign mr. paul was named by art & <unk> magazine as one of the top N individual <unk> in the u.s.
an <unk> <unk> to most of the art world paul is no <unk> to <unk> spending the magazine said noting that he does n't stop at <unk> on <unk> but also <unk> big on art you can eat
he recently bid $ N at a paris charity auction for a <unk> <unk> by six of the world 's great <unk> but the final party cost closer to $ N
mr. paul says it was n't that high
the art collection might have come to rival the <unk> ' had the florida comptroller 's office not got wind of mr. paul 's <unk> <unk>
in its letter to him <unk> march N and <unk> with reporters alex <unk> the chief of the <unk> bureau in the comptroller 's office expressed <unk> that the s&l could be so <unk> when it had reported losses of more than $ N million in its two <unk> quarters
the state gave <unk> N days to sell the <unk>
the comptroller 's office eventually extended the deadline to six months but <unk> its demands <unk> that the book value of the collection be reduced to <unk>
in other words get <unk> of all the pictures
the state <unk> noted that <unk> banking practices are <unk> for <unk> an officer or director and closed with the <unk> to mr. paul <unk> <unk> <unk>
the state agency was particularly <unk> to learn that the <unk> and a <unk> other <unk> listed among the bank 's furniture and <unk> were actually <unk> in the chairman 's house
mr. paul says that at one point he did indeed have eight or nine of the <unk> at home and that the rest were in storage at sotheby 's
he <unk> that he was merely <unk> the <unk> at home with some display because of the special <unk> environment required for their <unk> until <unk> 's new building was ready for them
still the <unk> was <unk>
it came on the <unk> of a number of local newspaper articles <unk> that mr. paul has benefited <unk> from his association with <unk>
for instance he got a $ N million loan from the s&l negotiated at a <unk> rate
he owns N N of <unk> 's shares
adding to mr. paul 's problems dealers some with <unk> interests insist that he <unk> rather too heavily on sotheby 's advice paid much too much for several pieces in the <unk> collection
the $ N million <unk> on the <unk> for example was a record price for the <unk> and maybe twice its value given a dispute among <unk> about its <unk>
david <unk> the president of david <unk> inc. a new york <unk> says <unk> question the <unk> of the <unk>
it may have been <unk> instead by a <unk> associate
the feeling among many experts on the commercial side is that the price paid at the time was <unk> in any event mr. <unk> says
it sounds like with the <unk> he got <unk> taken to the <unk>
<unk> <unk> the executive director of the <unk> association of america <unk> that mr. paul paid very <unk> for the <unk> and adds that getting <unk> of it any time soon for a similar sum would be quite a <unk>
it 's not beyond credibility the <unk> will <unk> be worth $ N million but whether it could be sold for that amount tomorrow remains to be seen
still predicting is <unk>
i 'm <unk> <unk> by what i see making these high prices
<unk> h. <unk> the son of the <unk> 's former owner mrs. <unk> <unk> <unk> the price talk as <unk> <unk>
dealers <unk> of the purchase price he says were themselves interested in buying the <unk> but lost out
mr. paul for his part <unk> the <unk> price saying a lot of the experts have never seen the thing itself
most of them were n't even born the last time the <unk> was <unk> publicly he says
art prices are <unk> but a good deal of <unk> is involved in <unk> statistics on sales
salomon brothers inc. the <unk> firm in its annual <unk> of investment returns reported that old <unk> <unk> N N in the year ended june N the greatest return of any of N assets it <unk>
<unk> and modern <unk> not <unk> by salomon are <unk> even higher at N N by sotheby 's
salomon moreover gets its data on art appreciation from sotheby 's whose prices go up with clients like mr. paul in its <unk>
the <unk> <unk> from consideration the many <unk> that go <unk> at auction
art <unk> track winners not losers
but art that has fallen sharply in value is rarely put up for sale
also at any of sotheby 's <unk> of old <unk> roughly one-third to <unk> of what is offered does n't sell at any price
it 's not that there are n't any bids but the bids do n't meet the minimum reserve prices set by the sellers
in january the <unk> <unk> that now <unk> at <unk> was expected to bring no more than $ N at auction until mr. paul came along with his $ N million
mr. hall of the <unk> <unk> says $ N million would have been an impossible price for anyone to ask for a <unk> four years ago
but from his <unk> point it is n't that mr. paul a customer of his too <unk> for the work a <unk> <unk> by an <unk> who is not a household word
the <unk> is N feet wide seven feet high
rather it just shows things have changed
mr. paul <unk> that he <unk> <unk> in old <unk> just before they took an upward turn
they went up N N last year and they 'll do it again this year he <unk>
they were a <unk>
everybody was out buying <unk>
sotheby 's vice president <unk> <unk> says the auction house has been <unk> mr. paul in selling the <unk>
and while sotheby 's chief rivals in the art world private art dealers wo n't be happy to hear it she adds a number of the <unk> have already been sold and at a substantial profit
mr. paul claims to have sold three <unk> at more than a N N profit
that is n't N N and the claim is n't <unk>
he <unk> <unk> that he <unk> too heavily on sotheby 's or mr. <unk>
mr. paul says he had not one but four advisers and that he never bid <unk>
after all he had the counsel of <unk> from the most <unk> <unk> in the world
he says he expects to sell the collection including the controversial <unk> carefully and <unk> just as it was put together
but in <unk> <unk> mr. paul 's holdings are <unk>
that is he is being <unk> to put them on the market too soon and has already gotten offers that are less than he paid for some of the art works
after a few years you can argue there has been natural appreciation says <unk> <unk> the publisher of <unk> 's annual price index of art <unk>
but quick turnover in <unk> is like <unk> your <unk> you end up with N N
people hold out and try to get a <unk>
sotheby 's <unk> itself and mr. paul in the matter
mr. <unk> says mr. paul was a quick study who worked <unk> and bought the best pictures available at the moment
on <unk> he paid a high price mr. <unk> concedes but he says those who bid less and dropped out were dealers who would then have marked up the <unk> to <unk> them at a profit to <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> at <unk> associates in san francisco <unk> it <unk> conflict of interest for an auction house to both <unk> a client on purchases and to set price estimates on the <unk> to be purchased
sotheby 's she says is wearing both <unk>
i ca n't see why there would be a conflict of interest says sotheby 's ms. <unk>
estimates are based on the previous price of similar works sold at auction and current market conditions and are not affected by any <unk> of who the potential buyer could be
frequently clients express interest in <unk> but do n't end up bidding she adds so we do n't know who the potential buyer will be
mr. paul in selling off his <unk> is seeking at least a N N return on the bank 's investment so as to prove that the venture was sound
mr. paul says that he has <unk> out over much of the <unk> and that potential buyers from as far away as japan and italy have <unk> the collection
because of the pressure on <unk> to sell dealers and <unk> have been trying to get the <unk> at <unk> prices
but so far mr. paul and his advisers are holding fast
one dealer martin <unk> of french & co. in new york says he would have <unk> to buy a <unk> <unk> de <unk> <unk> from the bank
i tried to <unk> the picture to buy it <unk> and sotheby 's would n't do it
they were <unk> his interests
meanwhile mr. paul and <unk> executives are getting <unk> about <unk>
mr. paul has been <unk> as the great <unk> or something <unk> <unk> e. <unk> an executive vice president of <unk>
the media she says have <unk> his personal life
mr. paul <unk> in agreement
i do n't think i have a life style that is <unk> so <unk> he says
but at just that moment he is <unk> in his office by a <unk> in <unk> who <unk> coffee from silver into a cup of china and <unk> the <unk> with <unk>
mr. paul says yes the ceiling in his executive <unk> is <unk> <unk>
the offices are done in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> books and of course a $ N million <unk>
but he <unk> that the <unk> be played down
do n't say it 's a gold ceiling
just say the offices are <unk> appointed he says
otherwise the regulators will take it for <unk> and <unk> everything 's got to be <unk>
figures do n't include taxes or transaction costs
companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts ' estimates
the companies are followed by at least three analysts and had a minimum <unk> change in actual earnings per share

the percent difference compares actual profit with the <unk> estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past N days
otherwise actual profit is compared with the <unk> estimate

the turmoil on wall street may benefit some retailers attempting to lead leveraged buy-outs of their specialty and <unk> chains investment bankers and retailers said
managers at five chains have said in recent weeks that they <unk> to bid for their companies
the chains include <unk> 's owned by campeau corp. toronto <unk> fifth avenue and marshall field 's owned by b.a.t industries plc london and b. <unk> & co. and <unk> inc. owned by hooker corp. which is now being managed by a <unk> <unk> <unk>
hooker is based in <unk> australia
the combination of so many chains available for sale the recent failures of such retailing lbo 's as miller & <unk> inc. and declining investor confidence will drive down prices retailing observers said
the pricing will become more <unk> which should help management said <unk> <unk> a new york investment banker with <unk> s. <unk> & co
investors are n't going to be <unk> money at any of the proposed <unk> but doing deals on the basis of <unk> <unk> never made sense either
earlier this year bankers and other investors were willing to provide financing because they assumed there would be major gains in both profitability and sales mr. <unk> added
those days are over now he believes
competition from third parties who have cash and are prepared to buy has always <unk> and will continue added mr. <unk>
but when prices were <unk> it was even harder to do an lbo
bankers believed in the <unk> theory that says somebody else is always willing to pay more
this is no longer true today
at <unk> fifth avenue paul <unk> senior vice president marketing agreed that lower prices will help his management team in their proposed lbo
having to take on less debt would certainly be an advantage said mr. <unk>
it would also help us in our search for equity partners
to make an lbo work now we are going to need more than just junk bonds
none believe the proposed management <unk> will be easy to complete especially at b. <unk> & co. which is under chapter N bankruptcy protection

further many institutions today holding troubled retailers ' debt securities will be <unk> to consider additional retailing investments
it 's called bad money driving out good money said one retailing <unk>
institutions that usually buy retail paper have to be more concerned
however the lower prices these retail chains are now expected to bring should make it easier for managers to raise the necessary capital and pay back the resulting debt
in addition the fall selling season has generally been a good one especially for those retailers <unk> on apparel sales for the majority of their revenues
what 's encouraging about this is that retail chains will be sold on the basis of their sales and earnings not <unk> values said joseph e. <unk> chairman and chief executive officer of <unk> taylor inc. a specialty chain
retailers who had good track records of producing profits will have a better chance to buy back their companies
still most retailing observers expect that all the proposed retailing <unk> will <unk> partly on the sale of junk bonds a market already in <unk> in part because of concerns associated with bonds issued by the <unk> and <unk> units of campeau
prices for retail chains are lower today than they were last week which will help management said <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> inc. an <unk> firm <unk> in retailing acquisitions
but the <unk> of financing still has to be resolved
potential <unk> will either look for greater equity participation on behalf of management or insist the equity <unk> of the deals be substantially greater than in the past

bay financial corp. hurt by high debts and <unk> real estate investments reported a wider loss for the fourth quarter and said it might be forced to seek a <unk> reorganization if it ca n't <unk> its <unk>
bay said a substantial part of its debt outstanding is in default as a result of <unk> to sell certain properties quickly and <unk> prices for sales made
the company said its real estate portfolio is highly leveraged while about two-thirds of its investments are n't <unk>
thus it is coming up short on a big bet that quick sales at higher prices would enable it to keep up with mortgage and other debt payments
according to its latest annual report about a quarter of the company 's holdings are in massachusetts in the <unk> of a real-estate slump
the company said it had a net loss in its fourth quarter ended june N of $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N million
a year earlier the company had a loss of $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N million
for the year it had a net loss of $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N million

the electronics automotive and aerospace concern said third-quarter net was $ N million or N cents a share down from $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier
share earnings are reported on a fully diluted basis by company <unk>
results for the N quarter included a gain of $ N a share from sale of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> cable units partly offset by a charge of N cents a share for <unk> of <unk> truck <unk> systems
the latest quarter included a gain of N cents a share as a partial <unk> of the <unk> charge because the reserve established last year exceeded the actual <unk> costs
sales for the quarter rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion with all three major product groups reporting gains
the company said aerospace and defense sales were up N N for the quarter to $ N million and operating profit climbed N N to $ N million mainly because of improved program performance in <unk> and <unk> contracts
automotive sales jumped N N to $ N million mainly because of higher sales of air <unk> and other <unk> <unk> systems <unk> said
the group had an operating profit of $ N million against a loss of $ N million a year earlier
however excluding the year-earlier charge for <unk> of <unk> <unk> operating profit in the latest quarter declined N N reflecting higher start-up and product development expenses in <unk> systems

as the <unk> stevens the <unk> <unk> of <unk> hall <unk> over such <unk> terms as <unk> <unk> service and loyalty we see how <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk>
stevens 's <unk> <unk> of the public and private <unk> like his <unk> <unk> 's <unk> all it was designed to <unk>
such <unk> <unk> the <unk>
the <unk> cuts to the quick
it 's N the year the <unk> crisis marked the final end of empire
as he stands on a hill at the beginning of a <unk> motor <unk> from <unk> to <unk> where a former <unk> <unk> perhaps the <unk> of an <unk> <unk> <unk> perhaps he hopes with more <unk> than he will ever <unk> not <unk> to return to domestic service stevens <unk> the view and <unk> provides a <unk> a <unk> and the author 's <unk> for the <unk> of the novel we 're reading
we call this land of <unk> great britain and there may be those who believe this a somewhat <unk> practice
yet i would venture that the <unk> of our country alone would <unk> the use of this <unk> <unk>
it is the very lack of obvious <unk> or <unk> that sets the <unk> of our land apart
what is <unk> is the <unk> of that <unk> its sense of <unk>
it is as though the land knows of its own <unk> of its own <unk> and <unk> no need to <unk> it
in comparison the <unk> of <unk> offered in such places as africa and america though <unk> very <unk> would i am sure strike the <unk> <unk> as <unk> on account of their <unk> <unk>
an <unk> <unk>
an <unk> mountain
but let stevens continue in his <unk> <unk> <unk> his <unk> efforts at <unk> always fail most <unk> this whole question is very <unk> to the question that has caused much debate in our <unk> over the years what is a great <unk>
his answer is one <unk> of a <unk> in keeping with his position
such <unk> has to do <unk> with a <unk> 's ability not to <unk> the professional being he <unk>
he will not be <unk> out by <unk> events however surprising <unk> or <unk>
<unk> are unable to be <unk> because they are as a <unk> <unk> of the emotional <unk> which only the english race are <unk> of
despite his racial advantage to be a great <unk> is a <unk> calling one 's <unk> is not unlike general 's headquarters during a battle
if for example in the <unk> of a great social <unk> such as an international conference on <unk> the <unk> treaty in N one 's <unk> father himself a great <unk> once should happen to die of a <unk> one must continue to serve the <unk> <unk> do n't think me <unk> <unk> in not <unk> to see my father in his <unk> condition just at this moment
you see i know my father would have <unk> me to carry on just now
it is this kind of <unk> and <unk> that allows stevens to <unk> for all its <unk> <unk> <unk> i <unk> that evening today i find i do so with a large sense of <unk>
we note the imperial public word used to deny private <unk> and <unk>
that stevens himself is not <unk> or <unk> but <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is entirely the author 's <unk>
mr. <unk> 's ability to create a <unk> <unk> voice that <unk> him to <unk> such <unk> domestic <unk> and political <unk> was <unk> clear in his previous novel an <unk> of the <unk> world set in japan after the war

this <unk> <unk> all that i find <unk> and <unk>
i will <unk> <unk> <unk> to serving him
this is loyalty <unk> <unk>
in the end after meeting with the former <unk> stevens <unk> by the <unk> at <unk> thinking of her and of his <unk> and <unk> i <unk>

i ca n't even say i made my own <unk>
really one has to ask <unk> what <unk> is there in that

<unk> <unk> who represents the soviet airline <unk> here has some <unk> that are wild even by the current standards of <unk>
in his office <unk> the <unk> of <unk> airport mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> out what he calls just ideas
first he suggests <unk> group ltd. the international aircraft leasing company based in <unk> could lease some of its boeing <unk> to the soviet airline
then <unk> <unk> the <unk> flag carrier could <unk> <unk> pilots to fly the <unk> and the fleet could be based here at <unk> airport
that 's not all he says
<unk> <unk> the <unk> airport authority could build a cargo <unk> in the soviet union
<unk> could lease some of its cargo planes to <unk> <unk> through <unk> for a <unk> cargo airline
and then there is his notion of an <unk> <unk> airline to <unk> <unk> to los angeles via <unk>
have the <unk> of <unk> gone to mr. <unk> 's head
hardly
the <unk> aviation connection is alive and well here at <unk> airport
<unk> is indeed talking about leasing western planes to <unk> and even about buying <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is in discussions with the soviet carrier about a cargo venture and other <unk>
<unk> <unk> already has so many ventures with <unk> that its chief executive is studying russian
unlikely as it may seem <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has <unk> the <unk> soviet airline <unk>
and as <unk> <unk> to boost its service standards <unk> its fleet and pursue commercial opportunities the <unk> aviation industry seems <unk> to benefit
<unk> and soviet people are similar says mr. <unk>
they look the same
they 're very friendly
moreover he says <unk> companies are small but <unk>
we have to study their experience very well he says
we must find any way to get business
the two groups have been working together since the late 1970s long before soviet joint ventures were the <unk> in the west
<unk> carried about N million passengers last year and <unk> airport the airline 's largest <unk> airport outside the soviet union saw N <unk> flights and N passengers pass through
an apartment complex down the road is the <unk> and <unk> area for more than N <unk> pilots and flight <unk>
the airport 's biggest supplier of aircraft fuel is the soviet union
<unk> from the <unk> <unk> of <unk> each year <unk> N million <unk> of fuel into a special <unk> farm at the airport
what <unk> does n't <unk> into its own <unk> <unk> is <unk> to the airport authority which <unk> it to N western carriers including air france <unk> world airlines and <unk> international airlines
<unk> thus pays its landing fees <unk> and <unk> bills with fuel <unk> its hard currency
that is n't all
last year the <unk> airport authority in a joint venture with <unk> opened four <unk> <unk> shops at moscow 's <unk> airport
<unk> <unk> now manages <unk> sales on all <unk> international flights out of moscow
<unk> shops in <unk> 's <unk> airport opened in july and <unk> shops in <unk> hotels and on the <unk> <unk> are coming soon
<unk> <unk> is talking about similar joint ventures in <unk> and in <unk> a black sea <unk> and even has a <unk> project <unk> with the <unk> city of <unk>
<unk> 's international fleet of N planes is being <unk> and <unk> at <unk> airport
thanks to a new <unk> agreement and the ability of <unk> travel agents to issue <unk> <unk> <unk> here are taking advantage of <unk> 's reasonable prices to board flights in <unk> for <unk> in <unk> <unk> and mexico city
the <unk> fare to <unk> is N <unk> <unk> $ N
<unk> costs N <unk>
a formal <unk> of <unk> was <unk> on this <unk> in april when <unk> and <unk> gorbachev stopped here for talks with <unk> prime minister charles <unk>
new trade <unk> were signed
it all started with <unk>
when it opened in N <unk> was the first <unk> in europe for <unk> <unk> flying from north america
advances in aircraft fuel <unk> over the years made a <unk> stop <unk> for most western air <unk> but <unk> still <unk> <unk> <unk> that ca n't make it from moscow to <unk> on one <unk>
as a result <unk> did n't <unk> the soviets after they shot down a korean air lines <unk> over the sea of japan in N though it suspended direct <unk> flights for two months
in fact <unk> <unk> started <unk> <unk> from <unk> to new york when washington <unk> <unk> of its u.s. landing rights
today <unk> <unk> is making a <unk> of money from its soviet <unk>
and with those <unk> in place it could be relatively simple to add <unk> <unk> and <unk> to the team
then perhaps mr. <unk> 's ideas would n't sound like so much <unk>
britain 's industrial production rose N N in august from july and was up N N from august N according to <unk> data from the central <unk> office

we 've had the <unk> and chinese and people from india <unk> us mr. <unk> <unk>
everyone in the world is watching us very closely
especially his <unk> the major u.s. <unk>
already usx corp. and <unk> inc. are studying <unk> 's technology to see if they can <unk> it
says the chief executive officer of a major <unk> steel company it 's <unk> <unk>
the <unk> steel industry is about to be turned <unk> by a 1990s technology revolution
new efficient and sophisticated <unk> make it easier for smaller less <unk> companies to make steel at a <unk> of what big steel paid decades ago
it also <unk> <unk> finally to get a <unk> in the <unk> steel market the major <unk> ' largest most <unk> and until now <unk> market
but such <unk> technology is only the beginning
eager engineers <unk> <unk> and direct <unk> which by the end of the 1990s will enable production without coke <unk> and <unk> <unk>
those massive structures while <unk> cost and environmental <unk> effectively <unk> out all but <unk> giants from <unk>
there 's a revolution ahead of us that will ultimately change the way we market and distribute steel says william dennis vice president manufacturing and technology for the american <unk> <unk> and steel institute
it is n't that major <unk> have <unk> ignored high technology
in fact they 've spent billions of dollars to boost the percentage of <unk> cast steel to N N in N from N N five years before
moreover their balance <unk> are rich with <unk> their old plants <unk> and work forces <unk>
but that wo n't <unk>
it 's no longer enough to beat the guy down the street
you have to beat everyone around the world says mr. dennis
he wants to see <unk> more involved in computers and <unk> intelligence
the problem they 're <unk> with huge plants that require costly maintenance
and try <unk> new dollars free in a market that is <unk> hurt by a strong dollar and concerned about <unk> the industry 's <unk> <unk>
the technology revolution is going to be very threatening to established producers says peter <unk> an analyst with painewebber inc
they 've got too much invested in the old stuff and they ca n't get their workers to be <unk>
no one expects <unk> to <unk> major integrated <unk> who remain the <unk> <unk> of <unk> steel used for <unk> and <unk>
<unk> 's plant in <unk> <unk> ultimately will produce only one million tons annually a drop in the <unk> <unk> steel <unk> and it will be years before such plants can compete in the <unk> market
still <unk> is the steel industry 's <unk> and <unk> representing about half of the N million tons of steel expected to be <unk> this year
moreover the process is n't without its <unk>
because all operations are connected one equipment failure forces a complete plant <unk>
on some days the <unk> plant does n't produce anything
at this point the <unk> capacity wo n't make a great <unk> in the integrated market but it does challenge them to develop new markets says james <unk> vice president materials at <unk> a technology and <unk> giant based in <unk> ohio
indeed with demand for steel not growing fast enough to absorb capacity <unk> will have to change the way they do business
in the past says <unk> 's chief economist john <unk> <unk> made a product and set it out on the <unk> <unk>
we said we 've got a product if you want it you can buy it he says adding now we 're <unk> out what people need and are going back to make it
<unk> 's sales representatives visit the general motors corp. 's <unk> assembly plant in kansas city <unk> two or three days a week
when they determined that gm needed parts more quickly <unk> convinced a steel service center to build a processing plant nearby so shipments could be delivered within N minutes
<unk> such relationships with major clients car and <unk> makers is a means of <unk> especially when those key clients are <unk> on a smaller pool of producers and <unk> with plastic and aluminum makers
for example when <unk> began talking about <unk> cars the american <unk> and steel institute began a major lobbying effort to show auto makers how they could use steel more <unk> by simply <unk> how a car door is <unk>
but <unk> must also find new markets
after letting <unk> take the <unk> lead a group of the nation 's largest <unk> started a <unk> institute to promote steel <unk> to an <unk> <unk> nation
<unk> 's mr. <unk> thinks <unk> should concentrate more on construction
<unk> steel corp. <unk> w. va. for example is <unk> to homeowners <unk> steel <unk> with <unk> glass <unk> as a secure and <unk> alternative to <unk> or aluminum ones
other <unk> <unk> steel <unk> covering <unk>
still others are looking at overseas markets
usx is <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> soviet union
this year the nation 's largest <unk> <unk> its overseas sales operation
producers also are trying to <unk> by <unk> on <unk> output such as <unk> and <unk> products which remain beyond the reach of <unk>
almost all <unk> programs announced by major <unk> within the past year involve building <unk> lines used to produce steel for such products as household <unk> and car <unk>
but unfortunately that segment is much smaller than the <unk> <unk> steel
it 's like everyone <unk> out of the <unk> ii and getting into a <unk> says john jacobson an analyst with <unk> consultants
after a while someone has to go over the side
although he does n't expect any <unk> he does see more plants being sold or closed
robert <unk> with the <unk> institute <unk>
unless there is an enormous rate of economic growth or a further drop in the dollar it 's unlikely that consumption of u.s. produced steel will grow <unk> to offset the growth of <unk>
not to <unk> the <unk> of imports
japanese and european <unk> which have led the recent technology developments are <unk> <unk> the <unk> of trade <unk> in N
moreover the u.s. can expect more competition from <unk> producing pacific <unk> and latin american countries

polaroid corp. 's <unk> damages case against <unk> kodak co. one of the highest stakes corporate <unk> ever is getting <unk> attention on wall street
after N days of <unk> <unk> in federal court in boston the trial is being all but ignored by analysts and patent attorneys
most have read the <unk> documents however and estimate kodak will be ordered to pay $ N billion to $ N billion for <unk> on seven polaroid <unk>
that may be the largest patent award ever but it is well below the $ N billion polaroid seeks
the highest patent damage award to date was in N when smith international inc. was ordered to pay $ N million to baker <unk> inc. for <unk> on a patent on an oil <unk> bit <unk>
the two companies later agreed to settle for $ N million
few analysts think it is worth their time to <unk> through the polaroid trial <unk>
it 's like <unk> for gold outside of grand central station
you might find something but the <unk> are low said michael <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk> & co
and <unk> <unk> an analyst at dean witter reynolds inc. said if you hired an attorney to be there all the time and give you a <unk> of the <unk> award i would be willing to bet that he would be off by a lot
a <unk> trial in the early 1980s determined that kodak based in <unk> n.y. <unk> on <unk> of polaroid of <unk> mass
the main issues remaining are how to <unk> damages and whether the <unk> was <unk> and <unk>
if so the damages could be <unk>
two analysts who have read the <unk> david nelson of shearson lehman hutton inc. and <unk> d. <unk> a litigation analyst at <unk> <unk> & co. think judge a. david <unk> will decide in kodak 's favor on the <unk> and <unk> issue
mr. <unk> said <unk> by kodak 's patent counsel <unk> t. <unk> of <unk> & <unk> showed that he worked with kodak <unk> from the <unk> of the project in an effort to avoid <unk>
<unk> told kodak on many <unk> to avoid various features because of polaroid 's patent positions and kodak followed his advice in every instance mr. <unk> said
but <unk> <unk> a patent expert at george <unk> university school of law who is familiar with the case said the fact that seven <unk> were <unk> suggests that <unk> was <unk>
it 's difficult to be that consistently wrong
observers also wonder whether judge <unk> will use the <unk> method of <unk> damages which polaroid <unk> because it would result in a larger award or the reasonable <unk> method
polaroid claims it could have <unk> and sold all the <unk> <unk> and film sold by kodak if kodak had n't entered the market
moreover polaroid contends it could have sold them at a higher price and thus made higher profits because it would n't have been forced to match kodak 's lower prices
each side has called a harvard business school professor to <unk> on that issue
kodak hired robert <unk> and polaroid brought in robert j. <unk>
there 's nothing that says that people at harvard business school have to agree with each other said mr. <unk>
<unk> is expected to continue until early december
a decision is n't expected until some time next year
international business machines corp. said earnings tumbled N N in the third quarter even a bit further than expected <unk> the outlook <unk> for the next few quarters
the main reason was a delay in <unk> of new <unk> disk drives a business that accounts for some N N of ibm 's $ N billion of annual revenue
ibm which <unk> the poor results three weeks ago also cited an increase in its leasing business which <unk> to <unk> in business long-term but cut revenue in the near term
in addition ibm noted that the stronger dollar has cut the value of overseas revenue and earnings when they are translated into dollars
earnings fell to $ N million or $ N a share somewhat below securities analysts ' revised expectations of around $ N a share
that compared with the year-earlier $ N billion or $ N a share which was <unk> by a <unk> gain from the sale of some mci communications corp. stock and by an <unk> amount from a payment by <unk> ltd. relating to a software dispute
revenue climbed N N to $ N billion from $ N billion
ibm <unk> n.y. remained <unk>
the computer giant whose u.s. results have been dismal for years noted that revenue rose again in the u.s. in the third quarter following an increase in the second period
the company said in a statement that demand for ibm products and services continues to be good world-wide
we do not see anything in the fundamentals of our business that would cause us to change our strategy of investing for profitable growth
securities analysts however remained <unk>
i think N will be another <unk> year said steve <unk> of first boston
<unk> stevens of dean witter actually cut his per-share earnings estimate to $ N from $ N for N and to $ N from $ N in N because he decided sales would be even weaker than he had expected
both estimates would mark declines from the N net of $ N billion or $ N a share which itself was well below the record ibm set in N
mr. stevens said he kept a <unk> <unk> on the stock only because all the damage has been done
he said the stock has n't traded below N N times book value over the past N years which at the moment <unk> to a stock price of $ N
the stock closed yesterday at $ N a share up just $ N in composite trading on the new york stock exchange as the market surged
analysts worry that the <unk> and leasing problems will last at least through the first quarter
a key part of the question is how soon does this <unk> come and how soon does production <unk> up said steve cohen at <unk> financial group
and the <unk> i 've had from customers is that it still could be a while
on leasing bob <unk> at <unk> research said he thinks ibm has hurt itself <unk>

yesterday 's rally was led by rjr holdings N N N bonds which initially tumbled three points or $ N for each $ N face amount to N N before <unk> to N N
bonds issued by <unk> <unk> <unk> and american standard also showed big gains <unk> almost all their losses from friday and early yesterday
but traders said the junk bond market increasingly is <unk> into a <unk> group in which trades can be <unk> easily and a larger group of <unk> bonds in which liquidity or the ability to trade without too much difficulty has steadily <unk> this year
liquidity has n't returned to the vast middle ground of the market said mr. <unk> of merrill
the <unk> are still <unk> said mr. <unk> of drexel
analysts are concerned that much of the high-yield market will remain <unk> for investors
paul <unk> associate professor at the massachusetts institute of technology 's <unk> school of management citing a pattern of junk-bond default rates that are low in the early years after issuance and rise later says we 're now in a period where we 're starting to see defaults from the big issue years of N to N
mark <unk> a senior vice president at standard & poor 's corp. <unk> that there is increasing concern about the future liquidity of the junk bond market
junk bonds are a highly <unk> market said lewis <unk> vice chairman of smith barney harris <unk> & co
there 's a whole <unk> of stuff that 's money good and a whole <unk> of stuff that 's not so good
analysts at standard & poor 's say junk bond offerings by <unk> <unk> <unk> seem to be growing
almost $ N billion of junk bonds that are considered <unk> include issues from sci tv <unk> holdings not related to <unk> co. <unk> <unk> furniture <unk> stores <unk> department stores national <unk> <unk> holdings <unk> <unk> transportation and price communications
you could still have some very bad times ahead said mr. <unk>
it 's possible to have a N N default rate in one year because we 're already seeing big problems in the <unk> of a pretty strong economy
i 'm certainly not comfortable saying we 've seen the bottom
but yesterday 's rally among good junk was a badly needed <unk> for the market
many issues <unk> off the floor mr. <unk> said and benchmark junk issues recovered all of their losses from friday and early yesterday
in contrast he says the stock market gained back only about half what it lost friday and the government bond market lost about half what it gained friday
traders said yesterday 's rally was <unk> by insurance companies looking for <unk> after a <unk> slide in prices the past month
in addition mutual funds did n't appear to be major sellers of high-yield securities as was expected
sometimes a <unk> is healthy said drexel 's mr. <unk>
people will learn to be more <unk>
if they do good credit analysis they will avoid the hand <unk>
i think the market is in good shape
should you really own stocks
that 's a question a lot of people are asking following the stock market 's <unk> display of volatility
<unk> financially and <unk> by friday 's <unk> <unk> drop in the dow jones industrial average and yesterday 's <unk> rebound they 're <unk> if an individual has any business being in the market
the answer say academic researchers money managers and investment specialists is yes as long as you approach the stock market as an investor
but they say people should n't try to be traders who buy and sell in an effort to ride the latest economic trend or catch the next hot stock
the case for <unk> stocks over the long-term is <unk>
if you look at N years worth of investment history including the great <unk> and every bear market since stocks have <unk> almost everything an individual could have owned by a long shot says <unk> berlin vice president at first <unk> capital management
a dollar invested in the stock market in N would have grown to $ N by the end of last june according to <unk> <unk> managing director at <unk> associates inc
but a dollar invested in long-term bonds in N would have grown to only $ N and a dollar put in treasury bills would equal a <unk> $ N
the longer the time period the less risk there is of losing money in the stock market
over time the odds increasingly favor the investor with a <unk> portfolio
for instance <unk> <unk> a san francisco money manager <unk> that if an investor holds a <unk> of stocks that <unk> the standard & poor 's 500-stock index the chance of losing money is N N to N N over a 10-year period compared with N N over three years and N N over one year
if you do n't need the money for N years there 's a <unk> case for <unk> to a steady core of stocks mr. <unk> says
stock-market investments also help balance the other assets an individual owns says john <unk> jr. president of the institute of <unk> financial planners
stocks have a place in an investors ' portfolio along with real estate bonds international securities and cash he says
there are some important <unk> before investing in stocks individuals should have at least three to six months of living expenses set aside in the bank most investment advisers say
individuals also should focus on building equity in a home which provides some protection against inflation as well as a <unk> that can be <unk> in late in life to help cover the cost of retirement living
people also should n't invest money in stocks that they 'll need in the near future for example for college tuition payments or retirement expenses
you may have to sell your stocks at a time when the market takes a plunge says mr. <unk> a <unk> <unk> calif. financial planner
but once the <unk> are covered then i would start to invest even if it 's as little as $ N says michael <unk> president of <unk> <unk> services inc
he says individuals should consider not just stocks but other long-term investments such as <unk> bonds
despite the strong case for stocks however most <unk> <unk> that individuals should n't try to profit from short-term developments
it 's very difficult to do says donald <unk> a market strategist for <unk> morgan securities a los angeles brokerage firm
our markets move so fast and they are so volatile there 's no way the average investor can compete with the <unk>
individual investors face high transaction costs of moving in and out of the market
the cost of <unk> stock orders <unk> from brokerage to brokerage and with the size of the order but N N of the order 's value is an average says stephen <unk> manager of t. rowe price 's growth and income mutual fund
and assuming their first investment is successful investors will have to pay taxes on their gains
that can reduce returns by a third or more once local taxes are included mr. <unk> says
after that individual traders face the risk that the new investment they choose wo n't <unk> well so their trading costs could be sustained for nothing
it 's very tough for most individuals to <unk> the mutual funds or the market says mr. <unk>
you should really think twice if you think you can <unk> the system
then too many individual investors lack the <unk> emotional <unk> professionals say is needed to plunge in and out of the market
so what 's the best way to buy stocks
unless an individual has a minimum of between $ N and $ N to invest in stocks he 's still better off in mutual funds than in individual stocks in terms of getting enough attention from a <unk> broker says mr. <unk>
still he adds i could see <unk> both given that individuals often have an advantage over big investors in <unk> special <unk> based on their own <unk> he adds
george douglas first vice president at drexel burnham lambert inc. says that individuals have a particular edge now in small to <unk> <unk> companies with <unk> earnings prospects a traditional <unk> ground for small investors
this growth sector which usually carries a <unk> <unk> about twice that of the standard & poor 's N <unk> to include some of the market 's most attractive <unk> right now
it 's now selling at a <unk> about even with the market says mr. douglas
moreover mr. douglas sees a <unk> of institutional interest in smaller growth stocks that could boost the performance of these stocks in the <unk> term
many big wall street brokerage firms who eliminated their research effort in stocks of emerging growth companies a few years ago are now <unk> coverage of this area he notes
we 're seeing a real turnaround in interest in small growth stocks he says
the <unk> <unk> <unk> individuals to stay away from the latest investment <unk>
they say that 's especially important this late in the growth phase of the economic cycle when there 's no robust <unk> market to <unk> investors out of their <unk>
friday 's <unk> <unk> a pretty good buying opportunity but let 's not <unk> at this point in the business cycle says <unk> <unk> chief equity portfolio strategist at first boston corp
buy stocks on weakness for their long-term fundamentals he says
in the long run investment advisers say most investors will be better off using the <unk> <unk> method of buying stocks
in this method a person <unk> a regular amount every month or quarter into the stock market whether the market is up or down
that cuts the risk mr. <unk> the san francisco money manager points out
when the market is low you are buying more shares and when it 's high you 're buying fewer shares he says
otherwise if you put all your money in at one time by <unk> bad <unk> you might pick a <unk> time and have to wait three years to get even mr. <unk> says
a <unk> program will work the best mr. <unk> says
one of the <unk> things to do is to buy stocks when the market is down he says
but that 's just the time when you should be buying them
<unk> annual returns including price changes and income from interest and dividends
<unk> actual performance not <unk>

donald trump who faced rising doubt about his bid for american airlines parent amr corp. even before a united airlines buy-out came apart friday withdrew his $ N billion offer
separately bankers representing the group trying to buy united 's parent ual corp. met with other banks about <unk> that purchase at a lower price possibly around $ N a share or $ N billion
but a lower bid could face rejection by the ual board
mr. trump who <unk> wednesday to go forward with the bid said he was dropping it in light of the recent change in market conditions
he said he might now sell his amr stake buy more shares or make another offer at a lower price
the manhattan real-estate developer <unk> after the ual buyers failed to obtain financing for their earlier $ 300-a-share bid which <unk> a selling panic among that <unk> into a <unk> drop friday in the dow jones industrial average
news about ual and amr whose shares never <unk> after trading was halted friday for the ual announcement sent both stocks <unk> in composite trading on the new york stock exchange
ual tumbled $ N to $ N on volume of N million shares and amr declined by $ N to $ N as N million shares changed hands
together the two stocks <unk> <unk> among takeover stock traders and caused a N N drop in the dow jones transportation average second in size only to the stock-market crash of oct. N N
some said friday 's market <unk> had given mr. trump an <unk> to <unk> out of an offer that showed signs of <unk> even before problems emerged with the ual deal
after <unk> an <unk> high of $ N the day mr. trump disclosed his bid oct. N amr 's stock had <unk> as low as $ N last week
some takeover stock traders had been <unk> against mr. trump because he has a record of <unk> stakes in companies that are potential takeover targets then selling at a profit without making a bid
he still has n't proven his <unk> as a <unk> <unk> <unk> said airline analyst <unk> <unk> of morgan stanley & co
he 's done this thing where he 'll buy a little bit of a company and then trade out of it
he 's written this book the art of the deal
why does n't he just follow through on one of these things
mr. trump withdrew his bid before the amr board which is due to meet tomorrow ever formally considered it
amr had <unk> a wide range of possible <unk> from flat rejection to <unk> and leveraged buy-outs that might have included either employees a <unk> buyer such as texas <unk> robert <unk> or both
amr had also sought to <unk> mr. trump in congress by lobbying for legislation that would have <unk> the authority of the transportation department to <unk> airline buy-outs
yesterday mr. trump tried to put the blame for the collapse of the ual deal on congress saying it was <unk> through a bill to protect amr executives
i believe that the <unk> that legislation in this area may be <unk> approved contributed to the collapse of the ual transaction and the resulting <unk> in the financial markets experienced this past friday mr. trump wrote members of congress
amr declined to comment and mr. trump did n't respond to <unk> for <unk>
mr. trump never said how much amr stock he had bought only that his holdings were substantial
however he only received federal <unk> to buy more than $ N million of the stock on sept. N when the price rose $ N a share to $ N
between then and his bid on oct. N the price <unk> between $ N and $ N
in an attempt to persuade investors that his bid was n't just a stock play mr. trump promised last week to <unk> the market before selling any shares
amr was trading at around $ N yesterday before his withdrawal announcement then immediately fell to about $ N
assuming that he paid a <unk> average price of $ N a share and assuming he did n't sell before his announcement reached the market mr. trump could be sitting with a modest loss with the stock at $ N
some analysts said amr chairman robert <unk> might <unk> the opportunity presented by the stock price drop to protect the nation 's largest airline with a defensive transaction such as the sale of stock to a friendly holder or company employees
however other <unk> observers said they believed mr. <unk> and the amr board might well decide to tough it out without taking any extra steps
some analysts said they believed mr. trump whose <unk> <unk> had been viewed by some as a reason to believe he would n't back out might come back with a lower bid
<unk> <unk> of <unk> read & co. said mr. trump is <unk> back and waiting for the <unk> to settle
i 'm sure he still wants amr
but others remained skeptical
i was never sure donald trump really wanted to take amr said john <unk> a bond analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc
what happened with united was a <unk> way for him to <unk> out
mr. trump never obtained financing for his bid
that <unk> would leave him with an even greater credibility problem should he return that would <unk> him in any effort to <unk> the board in a <unk> fight
meanwhile citicorp and chase manhattan corp. the two lead lenders on the ual buy-out met with other banks yesterday to determine if they would be willing to finance the buy-out at a lower price
officials familiar with the talks said citicorp had discussed <unk> the offer to $ N a share but said that price was a talking point and that no decision has been made
at $ N a share the group would have to <unk> about $ N billion from banks
the first ual deal <unk> after <unk> and chase could n't raise $ N billion
<unk> and chase had agreed to <unk> $ N billion and said they were highly confident of raising another $ N billion
together citicorp and chase received $ N million in fees to raise the rest of the financing
but other banks <unk> at the low interest rate and banking fees the ual group was willing to pay them
officials familiar with the bank talks said the ual buy-out group ual pilots management and british airways plc is now willing to pay higher bank fees and interest but is n't likely to boost its $ N million equity contribution
nor is the group likely to come forward with a revised offer within the next N hours despite the hopes of many traders
the group 's advisers want to make certain they have firm bank commitments the second time around
even if the buy-out group is able to obtain financing the transaction still faces <unk>
ual 's board could <unk> the new price as too low especially since there are n't any competing bids
los angeles investor marvin davis whose $ <unk> offer was rejected by ual 's board has n't shown signs of pursuing a $ 300-a-share <unk> bid he made last month
in addition the coalition of labor and management longtime <unk> who joined forces only under the threat of mr. davis 's bid could break apart now
the group 's <unk> gets its first test today when N top pilot union leaders <unk> outside chicago in a previously scheduled meeting
union chairman <unk> <unk> <unk> faces the tough task of <unk> why banks refused to finance a buy-out the members approved <unk> last week
the pilot union is <unk> to pursue an acquisition whatever the board <unk>
but if the board <unk> a reduced bid and <unk> to <unk> other alternatives it could <unk> what has been a <unk> process into an <unk> one
the pilots could play <unk> by noting they are crucial to any sale or restructuring because they can <unk> to fly the <unk>
if they were to insist on a low bid of say $ N a share the board might n't be able to obtain a higher offer from other <unk> because banks might <unk> to finance a transaction the pilots oppose
also because ual chairman stephen wolf and other ual executives have joined the pilots ' bid the board might be forced to exclude him from its <unk> in order to be fair to other <unk>
that could cost him the chance to influence the outcome and perhaps join the winning <unk>
<unk> members of the house ways and means committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new <unk> bailout agency can raise capital creating another potential <unk> to the government 's sale of <unk> thrifts
the bill whose <unk> include chairman <unk> <unk> d. <unk> would prevent the resolution trust corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an <unk> bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be <unk> on the federal budget
the bill intends to restrict the <unk> to treasury <unk> only unless the agency receives specific congressional <unk>
such agency <unk> borrowing is <unk> and expensive far more expensive than direct treasury borrowing said rep. <unk> <unk> d. calif. the bill 's chief <unk>
the complex financing plan in the s&l bailout law includes raising $ N billion from debt issued by the newly created <unk>
this financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from <unk> the budget deficit
another $ N billion would be raised through treasury bonds which pay lower interest rates
but the <unk> also requires working capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold until the assets can be sold separately
that debt would be paid off as the assets are sold leaving the total spending for the bailout at $ N billion or $ N billion including interest over N years
it 's a problem that clearly has to be resolved said david <unk> executive director of the <unk>
the agency has already spent roughly $ N billion selling N insolvent <unk> and it is likely to sell or merge N by the time the bailout <unk>
<unk> other working capital he said the <unk> would be forced to delay other thrift <unk> until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets
we would have to wait until we have <unk> on those assets before we can move forward he said
the complicated language in the huge new law has <unk> the fight
the law does allow the <unk> to <unk> from the treasury up to $ N billion at any time
moreover it says the <unk> 's total <unk> may not exceed $ N billion but that figure is <unk> after including notes and other debt and <unk> from it the market value of the assets the <unk> holds
but congress did n't anticipate or <unk> more public debt say opponents of the <unk> 's <unk> plan and rep. charles <unk> d. <unk> said the <unk> <unk> board has been <unk> in not keeping congress informed
that <unk> leads to a proposal like the one from ways and means which seems to me sort of <unk> he said
the <unk> is going to have to pay a price of prior <unk> on the hill if they want that kind of flexibility
the ways and means committee will hold a hearing on the bill next tuesday
we 're about to see if advertising works
hard on the <unk> of friday 's <unk> stock-market plunge and the uncertainty that 's followed a few big brokerage firms are <unk> out new ads <unk> a familiar message keep on investing the market 's just fine
their mission is to keep clients from <unk> the market as individual investors did in <unk> after the crash in october
just days after the N crash major brokerage firms <unk> out ads to <unk> investors
this time around they 're moving even faster
painewebber inc. <unk> a new television commercial at N p.m. edt yesterday and had it on the air by last night
<unk> investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday and wrote another new ad <unk> today
shearson lehman hutton inc. by yesterday afternoon had already written new tv ads
it considered running them during tomorrow night 's world series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday
other brokerage firms including merrill lynch & co. were <unk> out potential new ad strategies
the brokerage firms learned a <unk> the last time around when <unk> investors <unk> the phone lines and <unk> the market in a panic
this time the firms were ready
<unk> for example prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge
when the market went into its free fall friday afternoon the investment firm ordered full pages in the monday <unk> of half a dozen newspapers
the ads <unk> <unk> 's <unk> <unk> <unk> the huge <unk> <unk> is ready for your call
a <unk> spokesman says the <unk> which already was operating but which many clients did n't know about received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend
a lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us he says
to maintain that <unk> is <unk> crucial
it would have been too late to think about on friday
we had to think about it ahead of time
today 's <unk> ad goes a step further encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> it <unk> based on the events of the past week all investors need to know their portfolios are <unk> to help protect them against the market 's volatility
it goes on to <unk> a few <unk> <unk> funds by name
painewebber also was able to <unk> up quickly thanks to the N crash
in the aftermath of the N <unk> the brokerage firm began <unk> <unk> <unk> ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and <unk> it on the air that night
it also negotiated an arrangement with cable news network under which <unk> would agree to air its <unk> <unk>
the new painewebber commercial created with ad agency saatchi & saatchi co. features mary <unk> one of the firm 's most visible investment <unk> <unk> particularly bullish
<unk> just as the market closed yesterday it offers ms. <unk> advising we view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle
we continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long-term appreciation
the spot was scheduled to appear three times on <unk> last night
painewebber considered an even harder sell <unk> specific stocks
instead it settled on just urging the clients who are its <unk> to keep that money in the market
we 're saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and <unk> everything which just drives the prices down further says john <unk> painewebber 's director of advertising
if you owned it and <unk> it friday the true value has n't changed
he adds this is n't N <unk>
with the market <unk> and then closing up more than N points yesterday investment firms had to <unk> <unk> their approach
at shearson lehman executives created potential new <unk> friday night and throughout the weekend then had to <unk> yesterday afternoon
the plan had been to make one of shearson 's <unk> <unk> where we stand <unk> which have been running occasionally in response to news events since N
the ad would have run during the world series tomorrow <unk> the debut commercial of shearson 's new ad campaign leadership by example
but in a meeting after the market closed yesterday shearson executives decided not to go ahead with the stock-market ad
we do n't think at this point anything needs to be said
the market seems to be <unk> out we 're taking a <unk> attitude says <unk> b. <unk> executive vice president of marketing
in any case the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of N
but it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective
in N despite a <unk> of ads from most of the major investment firms individuals ran from the market <unk> <unk>
now the firms must try their <unk> to prove that advertising can work this time around

baseball that game of the long <unk> is the <unk> sport of the mean and the mean <unk> law caught up with the san francisco giants in the world series last weekend
the team that dumped runs by the <unk> on the chicago <unk> in the national league <unk> was held to just one in two games by the <unk> oakland a 's the <unk> that had been done <unk> <unk> by the los angeles <unk> and <unk> <unk> in last year 's <unk>
<unk> much of the damage was <unk> by a 's who had some <unk> up to do
in game two on a cool sunday evening in this land of <unk> <unk> a lot of the <unk> up was done by the a 's <unk> <unk> <unk>
he hit a N <unk> from <unk> <unk> into the <unk> stands in <unk> four to stretch his team 's lead from N to a <unk> N where it stayed
so what if <unk> had struck just seven home runs in N <unk> games and <unk> in the <unk> position of the a 's <unk>
if you get your <unk> and take a good <unk> anything can happen he later <unk>
on saturday night quite a few of the <unk> in green and gold <unk> away <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of past and no doubt future <unk>
mark <unk> the big <unk> oakland first <unk> had three hits in four at <unk> two more than he 'd had in the <unk> <unk> series in which he 'd gone <unk>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> N through N <unk> the bottom of the order got seven of their team 's N hits and <unk> four of its runs in a N decision
<unk> <unk> <unk> held the giants to five hits to account for the <unk> on the other side of the saturday <unk>
that he was the a 's <unk> <unk> during its american league campaign with a N mark plus two <unk> over toronto in the <unk> indicates he may have some evening up coming but with the way his <unk> <unk> is <unk> that might not be this week
the same goes for <unk> <unk> another veteran who <unk> early <unk> to permit the giants but a run and four hits in seven <unk> in sunday 's contest
every guy they put out there had a better <unk> than the guy before <unk> giant manager roger craig
he 's an <unk> who 's one of the leading <unk> of the <unk> delivery which looks like a <unk> until it <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
the <unk> of the <unk> is that the a 's go into san francisco 's <unk> park <unk> up two games to none in the <unk> <unk>
the <unk> to <unk> with here says that about three of four <unk> N of N that took N series leads went on to win it all
that 's not an average to <unk> giant <unk>
one might think that the home fans in this series of the <unk> called <unk> that 's a better name for a public <unk> than desire do n't you think would have been <unk> over the proceedings but they <unk> them in relative <unk>
<unk> of the two <unk> sat side by side in the <unk> seats of oakland <unk> and while they <unk> their <unk> and <unk> the opposition <unk> advanced no further at least as far as i could see
a few <unk> even showed up wearing <unk> <unk> the <unk> and <unk> of both <unk>
i 'm for the giants today but only because they lost yesterday
i love <unk> both
the only thing i 'm <unk> for is for the series to go seven games said david <unk> a sacramento <unk> at the <unk> before sunday 's go
the above represents a <unk> of either <unk> or <unk>
i choose to believe it 's the <unk> although it probably <unk> from the fact that just about everyone out here including the a 's and giants is originally from <unk> else
<unk> it to say that if this were a new york <unk> series or one between the chicago <unk> and white <unk> <unk> it 's possible you 'd need <unk> police in every other seat to separate <unk> fans and only the <unk> would <unk> their <unk>
anyway the a 's gave you a lot of <unk> to <unk> for
in the opening game besides <unk> and <unk> there was <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> who had lost a couple months of the season to <unk> <unk>
he was <unk> <unk> <unk> in game two moved a <unk> along in the a 's <unk> second <unk> and <unk> for his team 's final <unk>
such is his reputation among the east bay <unk> that when he hit his first career home run last season the <unk> who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an <unk>
not his <unk> <unk> <unk> 's
an a 's <unk> of the second game was <unk> <unk> who <unk> the hot side of the <unk> <unk>
he <unk> toronto in the <unk> with six hits seven <unk> and eight <unk> <unk> in N at <unk> and continued that by going <unk> at the <unk> sunday along with <unk> <unk> a base and <unk> a run
when you 're in the <unk> you see every ball <unk> he <unk>
the cold guys in the set were will <unk> <unk> mitchell and <unk> <unk> the giants ' N <unk>
they combined for N hits six home runs and N runs <unk> in in the five games against the <unk>
they went a <unk> <unk> here with <unk> <unk> and <unk>
it 's that last set of numbers as much as anything else that gives the giants hope in the series games to come
i believe in the law of <unk> declared san francisco <unk> <unk> <unk> baker after game two
i 'd rather see a <unk> <unk> who 's hot come up for the other side than a good <unk> who 's cold
but the old <unk> <unk> <unk> offered no <unk> about when good times would return to his side
when it goes you never know when you 'll get it back he said
that 's baseball

it therefore makes no sense for each market to <unk> different circuit <unk>
to <unk> maximum liquidity and <unk> price volatility either all markets should be open to trading or none
<unk> circuit <unk> would not have halted the slide in prices on friday but they probably would have made for <unk> less volatile <unk>

there 's nothing unusual about business groups pushing for more government spending
but the <unk> was created in N out of an organization that made its name fighting a <unk> administration proposal to take over all defense housing production
through the years the association has been an active member of the <unk> 's coalition pushing for such <unk> as the <unk> amendment
yet on matters close to <unk> home
the hud budget has dropped by more than N N since N <unk> mr. <unk>
we 've taken more than our fair share
i would n't have a problem if other programs had taken a similar hit
but <unk> support for subsidies is not related to the current housing <unk> over the years the <unk> has backed a host of public programs
it once pushed for a national housing production goal set by the federal government and has <unk> advanced <unk> housing measures
moreover <unk> one hud official the <unk> remains <unk> to internal pressure from members that <unk> in <unk> production
the association is pushing an extensive and expensive <unk> which would substantially boost spending above the current level of more than $ N billion annually
direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved <unk> expensive in the past and <unk> are <unk> to the benefit of <unk> developers and <unk> as <unk> by the <unk> hud scandal or <unk>
<unk> subsidies through the <unk> for instance are little better
though mr. <unk> says expanding <unk> lending would result in no cost to the government the <unk> <unk> of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing such as <unk> to the <unk> home market would result in a major expense
more important housing programs run by hud the <unk> and <unk> are <unk> in red <unk>
the <unk> alone lost $ N billion in fiscal N the government 's equity in the agency essentially its reserve fund fell to <unk> $ N billion
the federal government has had to <unk> in $ N billion into the <unk> housing program since N to keep the fund <unk> and the <unk> requested an additional $ N million for the fiscal year just ended
all told the federal government already guarantees more than $ N billion of mortgages
in its <unk> produced publication where will our children live the <unk> does <unk> that of course the full measure of housing <unk> can not be provided by the federal government
it points to the <unk> impact of local government <unk> particularly <unk> and building fees which <unk> the price of housing out of the reach of <unk> and <unk> people
but while the <unk> has suggested actions that states and <unk> should take to reduce regulatory barriers the association has proposed no <unk> legislative program comparable to say its detailed request for more federal subsidies to eliminate <unk> controls
the association a majority of whose N members build fewer than N units a year is like many other business <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> of the national taxpayers union it <unk> in two <unk>
the <unk> like the subsidies but at the same time they tend to be fiscal conservatives in terms of major issues such as the <unk> amendment
unfortunately the organization 's desire for <unk> <unk> to <unk> its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility
two years ago when the <unk> <unk> for the $ N billion <unk> housing bill the organization <unk> dropped out of the taxpayers ' coalition says ms. <unk>
as mr. <unk> of the <unk> acknowledges government is not going to <unk> the problem
the real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down
more money for hud will increase the deficit and <unk> the economy more money to <unk> that are <unk> their local housing markets will further <unk> them from the <unk> effects of their policies

and so it was on gray friday
the grand <unk> of this <unk> would appear to have been excess <unk>
even if that is so however it 's probably the case that no barriers should have been <unk> to stop the <unk> before the end of the <unk> <unk>
the <unk> began friday afternoon when word spread that the ual buy-out was <unk>
although the <unk> expects to <unk> together a <unk> offer consisting of less cash the failure to get cash from japanese and american banks confirmed a growing fear among <unk> that the <unk> of <unk> takeover deals is ending
lots of other <unk> made up the <unk> of course <unk> a surprisingly large increase in producer prices <unk> federal reserve <unk> and the bush administration 's temporary <unk> in trying to lower the capital-gains tax
as usual few favorable reviews were heard for that <unk> <unk> band of program traders although most serious studies suggest they only play the music that others write
what really <unk> the <unk> along wall street however was the sudden concern that whatever the reason the pool of debt capital is <unk> up
gray friday reflects a panic mainly by the takeover <unk> rather than the small investor as their highly <unk> investments in the deal stocks are <unk> by the <unk> <unk> up of the <unk> for deal financing
deal stocks led the market down as they <unk> the <unk> losses
ual which triggered the slide opened monday at $ N down about N N from thursday 's close
amr opened monday at $ N down nearly N N from thursday 's close
both took further hits yesterday
<unk> lost N N on friday paramount lost almost N N
a <unk> look <unk> that where deal financing has been secured the target 's stock price was not affected on friday
the <unk> prospects where the <unk> must line up a <unk> of banks <unk> issue billions in high-yield debt were where the damage was <unk>
the market for so-called junk bonds has been setting the stage for friday 's dramatic march for several weeks
the growing financial difficulties of recent <unk> <unk> or takeovers such as resorts international integrated resources and campeau 's retailing empire have cast a <unk> over the entire market for high-yield securities
investors have reacted by <unk> recent efforts to <unk> junk bonds by ohio <unk> and by <unk> ramada to <unk> <unk> its planned junk-bond sale and restructuring
as a result high-yield mutual funds have declined across the board and the many firms planning to sell $ N billion in junk bonds before year-end are <unk> <unk> times
these are all market <unk> putting aside the <unk> <unk> that the tax code gives to debt over equity and what we 've seen is the market <unk> them in
of course washington had n't been <unk> in the days leading up to the <unk> and its <unk> to <unk> in the <unk> <unk> remains a <unk> prospect but those preliminary steps should n't <unk> us from the basic market <unk> that was at work on friday
if it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and <unk> caused gray friday what are the implications for policy makers
after all the stock market 's response to the collapse of the ual deal might be taken to <unk> the <unk> direction of regulators
is this a case where private markets are <unk> of washington 's <unk> of wall street
<unk> not
to the extent that friday 's sell-off reflected a sudden <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> the message is that wall street and the private markets are fully <unk> of <unk> the appropriate incentives and <unk> on corporate behavior
the national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the <unk> judges of the investment quality of various lbo deals and leveraged <unk>
the recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the <unk> of bank capital for recent deals <unk> the <unk> of letting the free markets operate
if takeover premiums become <unk> if lbo <unk> become too aggressive then the private market will <unk> these problems more quickly and <unk> than will policy makers and the markets will move with <unk> speed to <unk> appropriate <unk>
yes the broader exchanges got caught up in the <unk> but they <unk> the tiger up all year
not surprisingly he sometimes <unk>
the <unk> and takeover <unk> got killed on gray friday while the <unk> managers of <unk> targets <unk> <unk>
if you identify with the <unk> managers you must <unk> that <unk> and effective relief from the <unk> of the takeover market is more likely to come from the <unk> than from washington
if you side with the <unk> and <unk> you clearly have more to fear from private investors than from regulators although the delaware courts should never be <unk>
the truth is washington <unk> politics better than economics
although the average <unk> is probably not <unk> too much from washington 's <unk> war against wall street regarding <unk> financial <unk> actual legislation would probably <unk> considerable <unk>
any such attempt to <unk> good debt from bad debt or to draw the line at a particular industry such as the airlines is likely to <unk> the <unk> that the <unk> amount of <unk> provides both to equity markets and economic <unk> in general
far better for policy makers to concentrate on the war against drugs panama and the deficit all of them <unk> that seem never to end

what else is one to make of the <unk> <unk> initiative just proposed by several major environmental groups and organized by the state 's attorney general
if passed by the voters the recently announced initiative would phase out major <unk> reduce <unk> <unk> <unk> by N N ban new <unk> <unk> ban chemicals thought to <unk> the ozone <unk> and create a new state environmental officer <unk> with a $ N million budget to <unk> any firm or agency he thinks is being too <unk>

even if one buys into the whole <unk> theory it is <unk> that reductions in a single state could have any impact on what is <unk> as a global problem
but if <unk> science and economics have nothing to do with the new environment initiative what is going on
the first place to look under these circumstances is at the ways in which the <unk> themselves will benefit
the key here is the <unk> of state attorney general john van de <unk>

mr. van de <unk> is the one who <unk> the plans from the various radical environmental groups and <unk> them into a single <unk> initiative to be placed on the <unk> for election on nov. N N

blue <unk> was able to <unk> off the $ N billion takeover of <unk> in N largely because different british and american accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for british companies
under british rules blue <unk> was able to write off at once the $ N billion in good will <unk> from the purchase

the answer will help determine whether applied continues to reach the ambitious goals set by mr. <unk>
the <unk> <unk> manufacturer went public at $ N a share in august N and mr. <unk> 's goal then was a $ N per-share price by N
strong earnings growth helped <unk> that price far ahead of schedule in august N

mr. <unk> is confident that the drive to <unk> certain <unk> markets will work at <unk> <unk> as it has at applied
he also <unk> an <unk> <unk> to develop a corporate culture that <unk> managers who produce and where <unk> is <unk>
mr. <unk> <unk> the new unit 's operations <unk> sound and adds that <unk> <unk> has been fairly successful in moving into markets that have n't interested larger competitors

within about six months things will be moving in the right direction he predicts
mr. <unk> figures it will be easier to turn <unk> <unk> around since he 's now in the <unk> 's seat
when he came to applied i did n't have the power to <unk> as i do today he says
he was named chief executive officer of applied in N and became chairman last november
at applied mr. <unk> set growth as his first <unk>
he took the company public in an offering that <unk> applied about $ N million which helped launch the company 's acquisition program
sales climbed to an estimated $ N million in fiscal N ended aug. N from $ N million in fiscal N
the company expects that earnings which have <unk> steadily upward in recent years reached about $ N million or $ N a share in the fiscal year just ended up from $ N million in fiscal N and $ N million in N
