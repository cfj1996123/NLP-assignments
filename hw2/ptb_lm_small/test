<unk> described the <unk> at the time as a way for it to share the <unk> with its holders because its stock price was n't reflecting the huge profit increases

other countries that do n't have formal steel <unk> with the u.s. such as taiwan <unk> and <unk> also have <unk> steel
some of these countries have in recent years made <unk> agreements with the u.s. that are similar to <unk>
the bush administration earlier this year said it would extend steel <unk> known as <unk> <unk> agreements until march N N

south korea which had N N under the previous <unk> is set to get a small increase to about N N
that increase rises to slightly more than N N of the u.s. market if a joint <unk> steel project is included

the u.s. had about an extra N N of the domestic steel market to give to foreign suppliers in its <unk> talks
that was essentially made up of a N N increase in the overall <unk> program and N N from cutting japan 's <unk>
<unk> from the white house trade office will <unk> these <unk> negotiations next year when they will have another N N of the u.s. steel market to <unk>
these <unk> <unk> increases to the steel <unk> program are built into the bush administration 's <unk> program to give its <unk> <unk> with foreign steel suppliers to try to get them to <unk> subsidies and <unk> from their own steel industries

mr. <unk> said <unk> should realize a minimum of $ N of <unk> net earnings for each machine each month

the cincinnati <unk> giant got <unk> two years ago in japan when <unk> introduced a powerful <unk> called attack which quickly won a N N stake in the japanese markets
they do n't want to get caught again says one industry <unk>
retailers in phoenix ariz. say p&g 's new <unk> <unk> to be called <unk> with color guard will be on <unk> in that market by early november
a p&g spokeswoman confirmed that shipments to phoenix started late last month
she said the company will study results from this market before expanding to others
<unk> are n't entirely new for p&g
the company introduced a <unk> <unk> <unk> in japan after watching the success of attack
when attack hit the <unk> in N p&g 's share of the japanese market fell to about N N from more than N N
with the help of <unk> <unk> p&g 's share is now estimated to be N N
while the japanese have <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk> products the true test for p&g will be in the $ N billion u.s. <unk> market where growth is slow and <unk> have gained <unk> over <unk>
the company may have chosen to market the product under the <unk> name since it 's already expanded its <unk> <unk> into N different <unk> including this year 's big hit <unk> with <unk>
with <unk> however it is n't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more many people tend to <unk> too much <unk> into the <unk> machine <unk> that it takes a cup of <unk> to really clean the <unk>
in the early 1980s p&g tried to launch here a <unk> <unk> under the <unk> brand name that it markets in europe
but the product which was n't as <unk> as the new <unk> <unk> in a market test in denver and was dropped
p&g and others also have tried <unk> to <unk> consumers on <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> but they have n't sold well despite the <unk>
but p&g contends the new <unk> is a <unk> formula that also offers an <unk> that <unk> <unk> from <unk>
and retailers are expected to <unk> the product in part because it will take up less shelf space
when shelf space was cheap bigger was better says <unk> <unk> an analyst at salomon <unk>
but with so many brands <unk> for space that 's no longer the case
if the new <unk> sells well the trend toward smaller <unk> is likely to <unk> as competitors follow with their own <unk>
then retailers will probably push the <unk> brands out <unk> he says
competition is <unk> to get tougher if <unk> <unk> a product like attack in the u.s.

she added that she expected perhaps to have a down payment some small step to <unk> the american people and the japanese people that we 're moving in <unk>
how such <unk> <unk> into policy wo n't become clear for months
american and japanese officials offered several <unk> for the difference in approach <unk> mr. <unk> and mrs. hills

separately the company said it would file a delayed <unk> report with the securities and exchange commission within approximately N days

the oil industry 's <unk> profits could <unk> through the rest of the year
major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago largely reflecting <unk> chemical prices and gasoline profitability
the gasoline picture may improve this quarter but chemicals are likely to remain weak industry executives and analysts say reducing <unk> that profits could equal their year-earlier performance
the industry is seeing a <unk> somewhat in volume and certainly in price in <unk> <unk> <unk> president of phillips petroleum co. said in an interview
that change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings for the industry in general he added
he did n't forecast phillips 's results
but securities analysts say phillips will be among the companies <unk> by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third-quarter earnings
so too many analysts predict will exxon corp. chevron corp. and amoco corp
typical is what happened to the price of <unk> a major commodity chemical produced in vast amounts by many oil companies
it has plunged N N since july to around N cents a pound
a year ago <unk> sold for N cents <unk> at about N cents last december
a big reason for the chemical price <unk> is <unk>
beginning in <unk> prices began <unk> as a growing u.s. economy and the weak dollar <unk> demand
companies added capacity <unk>
now greatly increased supplies are on the market while the dollar is stronger and domestic economic growth is slower
third-quarter profits from gasoline were weaker
refining margins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year said william <unk> a securities analyst at first boston corp
oil company <unk> ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in july and august that did n't <unk>
the excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period
in addition crude oil prices were up some from a year earlier further <unk> profitability
<unk> say margins picked up in september and many industry officials believe gasoline profits will rebound this quarter though still not to the level of N 's fourth quarter
during the N second half many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits
crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising <unk> of companies ' earnings this year
prices <unk> roughly $ N a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier have stayed well above most companies ' expectations
demand has been much stronger than anticipated and it typically <unk> in the fourth quarter
we could see higher oil prices this year said <unk> <unk> an analyst at painewebber inc
that will <unk> into sharply higher production profits particularly compared with last year when oil prices steadily fell to below $ N a barrel in the fourth quarter
while oil prices have been better than expected natural gas prices have been worse
in the third quarter they <unk> about N N less than they were in N
the main reason remains weather
last summer was <unk> for a heat wave and <unk> that caused utilities to <unk> more natural gas to feed increased electrical demand from air <unk> use
this summer on the other hand had <unk> weather than usual
we 've been very <unk> in the performance of natural gas prices said mr. <unk> phillips 's president
the <unk> gas price is not going to assist fourth quarter performance as many had expected
going into the fourth quarter natural gas prices are <unk> from N N to N N lower than a year earlier
for instance natural gas currently produced along the gulf coast is selling on the spot market for around $ N a thousand <unk> feet down N N from $ N a thousand <unk> feet a year ago

to make its point it is <unk> the italian government to explain reports that olivetti may have <unk> the soviet union with sophisticated <unk> devices that could be used to build parts for <unk> aircraft
the london sunday times which first reported the u.s. concerns cited a u.s. intelligence report as the source of the allegations that olivetti <unk> $ N million in <unk> <unk> <unk> manufacturing systems to the soviet aviation industry
olivetti reportedly began shipping these tools in N
a state department spokesman acknowledged that the u.s. is discussing the allegations with the italian government and <unk> but declined to <unk> any details
italian president <unk> <unk> promised a quick investigation into whether olivetti broke <unk> rules
president bush called his attention to the matter during the italian leader 's visit here last week
olivetti has denied that it violated <unk> rules <unk> that the reported shipments were <unk> <unk> by the italian authorities
although the <unk> of these sales is still an open question the disclosure could n't be better <unk> to support the position of <unk> <unk> in the pentagon and the intelligence community
it seems to me that a story like this <unk> just before every important <unk> meeting said a washington <unk> for a number of u.s. computer companies
the bush administration has sent <unk> <unk> about its <unk> policies reflecting <unk> divisions among several competing agencies
last summer mr. bush moved the administration in the direction of <unk> <unk> when he told a north atlantic treaty organization meeting that he would allow some <unk> to the <unk> <unk> of strategic goods
but more recently the pentagon and the commerce department <unk> <unk> over the extent to which <unk> should <unk> exports of personal computers to the bloc
however these agencies generally agree that the west should be cautious about any further <unk>
there 's no evidence that the soviet program to <unk> acquire western technology has <unk> said a state department spokesman

i did n't <unk> calling anybody i did n't even turn on tv
there has n't been any fundamental change in the economy added john <unk> whose procter & gamble co. took an $ N slide to close at $ N

the real estate slump that 's pushing down the price of new york office space and housing is also affecting the city 's retail real estate market
in manhattan <unk> store sites sit <unk> and newly <unk> space has been slow to fill
retail real estate brokers say <unk> are reluctant to sign <unk> because of uncertainty about the local economy turmoil in their own industries and a belief that <unk> have not yet hit bottom
there is an <unk> amount of space available says <unk> <unk> senior vice president at <unk> associates store leasing inc
there are about N stores for <unk> up from a more typical range of N to N
this further <unk> retailers she says
they wonder should they sign a lease if prices are still coming down

in addition ms. <unk> says <unk> usually can <unk> to pay <unk> that are about <unk> lower than <unk> ' initial asking price
a handful of hot retail <unk> such as the <unk> street and <unk> and fifth avenue areas have been able to <unk> what many see as <unk> <unk>
and in some <unk> <unk> have merely hit a <unk>
but on average manhattan retail <unk> have dropped N N to N N in the past six months alone experts say
that follows a more <unk> decline in the prior six months after manhattan <unk> had run up rapidly since N
the same factors <unk> demand for office space have affected retailing
as businesses contract or <unk> the number of employees who might use retail services <unk> says edward a. <unk> senior vice president of helmsley <unk> inc
he says financial problems <unk> electronics fur and furniture companies key categories in the local retail economy have further <unk> the market

the trend toward lower <unk> may seem surprising given that some <unk> in new york are <unk> the loss of favorite local businesses to high <unk>
but despite the recent <unk> for many of these retailers there 's still been too big a jump from the <unk> rates of the late 1970s when their <unk> were signed
certainly the recent drop in prices does n't mean manhattan comes cheap
new york retail <unk> still run well above the going rate in other u.s. cities

when justice william <unk> marks the start of his <unk> year on the supreme court today the <unk> will <unk> sharply from previous <unk> of his <unk>
for the first time the <unk> justice finds his influence almost <unk> in <unk> rather than as a force in the high court 's majority
this role <unk> holds true as well for his three liberal and moderate allies <unk> <unk> marshall harry <unk> and john stevens
but are these four players three of them in their <unk> ready to assume a different role after N years <unk> of service on the high court
every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role and the <unk> that go with it but in different ways
<unk> <unk> and stevens appear <unk> about it <unk> marshall and <unk> appear fighting <unk>
the four <unk> are no <unk> to <unk> often joining forces in the past decade to <unk> the court 's conservative <unk>
but always in years past they have <unk> the trend and have been able to pick up a fifth vote to <unk> out a number of major <unk> in civil rights and <unk> cases
now however as the court 's new <unk> conservative majority continues to <unk> <unk> for the <unk> are <unk>
the change is most dramatic for justice <unk> the last <unk> of the <unk> liberal majority under chief justice <unk> <unk>
in the seven supreme court terms from the fall of N through the spring of N the <unk> of the <unk> court 's power justice <unk> cast only N <unk> votes in N cases decided by the court
last term alone he cast N <unk> votes in N decisions with the <unk> <unk> ruling as his only big victory
but justice <unk> <unk> his new role strongly <unk> the importance of <unk> in a N speech
each time the court <unk> an issue the <unk> will be forced by a <unk> to <unk> the fundamental questions and to <unk> the result he said
moreover in recent months he has said that when he was on the winning side in the <unk> he knew that the <unk> might turn in the future
he has said that he now knows how justice john <unk> felt a <unk> to the late conservative justice who was the most <unk> <unk> from the <unk> court 's <unk>
associates of <unk> justice marshall say he was depressed about the court 's direction last spring but is <unk> about his role and determined to speak out against the court 's <unk> in civil rights
we could <unk> it under the <unk> and <unk> it but i 'm not going to do it he said in a speech last month
he like justice <unk> <unk> <unk> highly important for the future a point that has n't <unk> legal <unk>
harvard law school professor <unk> <unk> says there is a <unk> <unk> to current <unk>
the <unk> in the <unk> court he says appeared to be writing for the short-term <unk> that the court 's direction might change soon
<unk> and marshall are <unk> in their <unk> to a more <unk> future he says
justice <unk> who will turn N next month also seems <unk> about his new role
associates say he takes some <unk> more <unk> than his colleagues especially attempts to <unk> the right to abortion first <unk> in his N opinion <unk> vs. <unk>
friends and associates who saw justice <unk> during the summer said he was no more <unk> about the court than in recent years
and his outlook improved after successful <unk> <unk> in august
but his level of <unk> showed in a recent <unk> speech to a group of hundreds of lawyers in chicago
he concluded his <unk> by <unk> <unk> and at some <unk> according to those present the late martin <unk> king 's famous i have a <unk> speech from the N march on washington
justice stevens N is probably the most <unk> of the <unk> about his role in part because he may be the least liberal of the four but also because he <unk> the <unk> challenge of <unk> with the majority more than the others
if the role these four <unk> are assuming is a familiar one in modern supreme court history it also <unk> in an important way from recent history court <unk> say
the <unk> of the <unk> court were often <unk> a legal <unk> that they <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> howard of the university of virginia law school but the <unk> today are <unk> a <unk> that they created
the government sold the deposits of four <unk> institutions in its first wave of sales of big <unk> thrifts but low bids <unk> the sale of a fifth
the four <unk> were sold to large banks as was the case with most of the N previous transactions <unk> by the resolution trust corp. since it was created in the s&l bailout legislation two months ago
two of the four big thrifts were sold to <unk> corp. <unk> <unk> which has aggressively expanded its markets particularly in texas and florida
a canadian bank bought another thrift in the first <unk> transaction with a foreign bank
under these deals the <unk> sells just the deposits and the healthy assets
these <unk> transactions leave the bulk of bad assets mostly real estate with the government to be sold later
in these four for instance the <unk> is stuck with $ N billion in bad assets
<unk> paid premiums ranging from N N to N N for the deposits and branch systems roughly in line with what analysts were expecting
the buyers will also be <unk> into deposit rates for just two weeks as has been the case with previous deals
after that the buyers may <unk> the rates paid by the former thrifts
but it 's uncertain whether these institutions will take those steps
<unk> for example has been one of the highest rate <unk> in the texas market and in florida rates are especially sensitive in retirement <unk>
the <unk> had previously <unk> five thrifts for quick sales in order to spend cash by certain <unk> <unk> but the delays <unk> the tough <unk> facing the agency
these thrifts are <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> an industry consultant based in <unk> <unk>
for example the delay in selling people 's <unk> savings <unk> <unk> with $ N billion in assets has forced the <unk> to consider selling off the thrift <unk> instead of as a whole institution
<unk> continued its <unk> into the florida and texas markets
<unk> will acquire university federal savings association houston which had assets of $ N billion

time magazine in a move to reduce the costs of <unk> new subscribers is <unk> its circulation guarantee to advertisers for the second consecutive year increasing its <unk> rates and cutting back on merchandise <unk>
in an announcement to its staff last week executives at time warner inc. 's weekly magazine said time will <unk> <unk> its use of electronic <unk> such as <unk> in television <unk> drives cut the circulation it guarantees advertisers by N to four million and increase the cost of its annual <unk> rate by about $ N to $ N
in a related development the <unk> for the fourth year in a row said it wo n't increase its advertising rates in N a full <unk> page in the magazine costs about $ N
however because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered ad rates will be effectively N N higher per <unk> according to richard <unk> time associate publisher
time is following the course of some other <unk> magazines that in recent years have <unk> the publishing <unk> that maintaining <unk> high and expensive <unk> is the way to draw advertisers
in recent years <unk> 's <unk> new york times co. 's <unk> 's and most recently news corp. 's tv guide have cut their massive circulation rate <unk> to eliminate <unk> circulation and hold down rates for advertisers
deep <unk> in <unk> and offers of free <unk> <unk> and <unk> have become accepted forms of <unk> new subscribers in the <unk> world of magazine <unk>
but time as part of the more <unk> time warner wants to <unk> itself away from expensive <unk>
besides time executives think selling a news magazine with a <unk> radio is <unk>
<unk> just give people the wrong image said mr. <unk>
that <unk> takes the focus off the magazine
time magazine executives <unk> <unk> the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers
what we are doing is <unk> out the readers who are only <unk> related to the magazine and do n't really read it said mr. <unk>
we are trying to create quality and involvement
however time executives used the same <unk> when in october N the magazine cut its guaranteed circulation from N million to N million
and time 's paid circulation according to audit bureau of <unk> dropped N N to N in the six months ended june N N
still time 's move is being received well once again
it 's <unk> for advertisers to know the <unk> will be paying more said michael <unk> national media director at <unk> inc. ad agency
a few <unk> in circulation are of no <unk>
it 's not a show of weakness they are <unk> the quality of circulation while <unk> their profits
mr. <unk> said the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry a magazine 's net revenue per <unk> or the actual revenue from subscribers after <unk> and the cost of premiums have been <unk> away
the question is how much are we getting from each <unk> said mr. <unk>
time 's rivals <unk> washington post co. 's <unk> and u.s. news & world report are less <unk> on electronic <unk> and in recent years both have been increasing their circulation rate <unk>
both magazines are expected to announce their ad rates and circulation levels for N within a month
when the news broke of an attempted coup in panama two weeks ago sen. christopher <unk> called the state department for a <unk>
they said follow <unk> he told reporters
that shows how far ted turner 's cable news network has come since its <unk> nine years ago when it was considered the <unk> of television news
it is bigger faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks
its <unk> as the network of record during major <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> around the world
but for all its success <unk> has hit a <unk>
although <unk> <unk> when big news <unk> it <unk> during periods of <unk>
<unk> executives worry that the network 's <unk> but <unk> news <unk> may be getting <unk> and wo n't keep <unk> coming back as the alternatives <unk> for news and information on <unk>
just the fact we 're on N hours is no longer <unk> says <unk> turner <unk> 's executive vice president news <unk> and no <unk> to ted turner
you ca n't live on that
so <unk> a unit of <unk> turner broadcasting system inc. is trying to <unk> itself as a primary channel or what people in the television industry call a top of mind network
<unk> to <unk> off the effort <unk> will <unk> its first <unk> <unk> in years an <unk> show at N <unk> eastern time to air <unk> against the network <unk>
the show will be <unk> by bernard <unk> and <unk> <unk> a <unk> former texas judge and <unk> <unk> <unk> who has never held a job in television or <unk>
the new show is perhaps the <unk> in a number of steps the network is taking to build audience loyalty by <unk> away from its current <unk> toward more <unk> <unk> programming with <unk> <unk>
to <unk> itself <unk> is also expanding international coverage and adding a second <unk> program
it is paying higher salaries after years of <unk> to <unk> and keep experienced <unk>
and it is <unk> on an expensive gamble to break major stories with a large <unk> team
the next stage is to get beyond the opinion leaders who use us as a point of <unk> to become a point of <unk> at <unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> executive vice president of <unk> news <unk> 's <unk> network
but that wo n't be easy
networks like other consumer products develop <unk> in <unk> ' <unk> that are n't easy to change
it also takes money that <unk> has been reluctant to spend to make programs and hire <unk> that <unk> will <unk> in <unk> to see
and the <unk> operators <unk> 's <unk> and part owners like things just the way they are
the <unk> bid is aimed at <unk> 's <unk> <unk> and what may happen to it as the <unk> news market grows more competitive
already <unk> is facing stronger competition from financial news network inc. and general electric co. 's consumer news and business channel both of which are likely to pursue more general news in the future
in addition many <unk> systems themselves are <unk> more local and regional news programs produced by local broadcast stations
<unk> wants to change its <unk> ' <unk>
its <unk> are on the whole a <unk> group of <unk> <unk> and news <unk> who spend an average of just N minutes a day watching <unk> according to audience research
that 's less than one-third the time that <unk> watch the major broadcast networks
the brief attention <unk> give <unk> could put it at a <unk> as ratings data and advertising become more important to <unk> <unk>
<unk> 's <unk> <unk> have been <unk> by its <unk>
its strategy in the past has been to serve as a tv <unk> service
it <unk> on building up its news <unk> around the world so as events took place it could go live <unk> and longer than other networks
it filled its daily schedule with <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but the shows <unk> little in <unk> <unk> or look
now the push is on for <unk> shows
our goal is to create more programs with an individual <unk> says paul <unk> <unk> executive vice president for programming
<unk> <unk> is adding a <unk> show in the morning because <unk> show its <unk> hour in the afternoon is among its most <unk> programs in <unk> ' <unk> says mr. <unk>
and it is <unk> other original programs similar to its <unk> king live and <unk> talk shows which executives hope will keep people <unk> in
then there 's the world today the <unk> <unk> <unk> mr. <unk> and ms. <unk>
until now <unk> has <unk> its hollywood <unk> show during the key evening period
but N N of the <unk> households that watch news do so between N p.m. and N p.m. the network discovered so <unk> wants in
mr. <unk> says the <unk> team will probably do two live <unk> a day with most of the program at least for now <unk> similar to <unk> 's other <unk>
some in the industry are skeptical
i find it hard to <unk> of people <unk> over to <unk> for what at least in the public 's mind is the same news says <unk> frank the former <unk> president of nbc news and <unk> of the <unk> report
the evening news is also <unk> as <unk> 's stage for its big push into <unk> <unk>
in august the network hired <unk> producer <unk> hill the former head of news <unk> at abc
she 's <unk> a staff of about N <unk> reporters who will produce weekly <unk> segments with an eye toward breaking big stories
<unk> executives hope the <unk> created by such <unk> will generate <unk> for its <unk> programs in the way N minutes did so well for cbs
that 's such a <unk> from the past that many in the industry are skeptical <unk> will follow through with its <unk> commitment especially after it sees the cost of producing <unk> pieces
they 've never shown any <unk> to spend money on production says michael <unk> a senior producer with <unk> <unk> who notes that <unk> is <unk> to his job
the network 's salaries have always <unk> far below industry standards resulting in a <unk> work force
<unk> recently gave most employees raises of as much as N N but they 're still <unk> <unk> compared with the networks
says mr. <unk> <unk> is my <unk> service they 're on top of everything
but to improve they 've really got to make the investment in people
in any case <unk> operators have reason to fear any <unk> with <unk> 's <unk>
they market <unk> on the very <unk> opportunities <unk> seeks to <unk>
we would obviously be <unk> if those kinds of services <unk> into more <unk> <unk> programming says robert <unk> senior vice president programming of continental <unk> inc. which holds a N N stake in turner broadcasting
the second u.s. circuit court of appeals opinion in the <unk> <unk> case did not <unk> the position <unk> co. took in its dispute with texaco <unk> to your sept. N article court <unk> texaco 's view in <unk> case too late
the fundamental rule of contract law applied to both cases was that courts will not <unk> agreements to which the parties did not <unk> to be <unk>
in the <unk> litigation the courts found <unk> and <unk> oil intended to be <unk> in <unk> <unk> they found there was no <unk> to be <unk>
<unk> the principle in the cases is the same
but the outcome of a legal dispute almost always turns on the facts
and the facts as found by the various courts in these two lawsuits were different
when you suggest otherwise you leave the <unk> of reporting and enter the <unk> of speculation

we support all efforts to remove <unk> <unk> from control of <unk> 's inc. and the <unk> 's system
the group said it would consider among other things <unk> <unk> payments and <unk> a <unk> lawsuit seeking court approval for the <unk>

september 's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still <unk> and the <unk> over interest rates caused by the new price data contributed to the stock market 's plunge friday
after falling for three consecutive months the producer price index for finished goods shot up N N last month the labor department reported friday as energy prices jumped after <unk> through the summer
although the report which was released before the stock market opened did n't <unk> the <unk> drop in the dow jones industrial average analysts said it did play a role in the market 's decline
analysts immediately viewed the price data the <unk> inflation news in months as evidence that the federal reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped
further <unk> the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the fed from easing credit the commerce department reported friday that retail sales grew N N in september to $ N billion
that rise came on top of a N N gain in august and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy
i think the friday report combined with the actions of the fed weakened the belief that there was going to be an <unk> easing of monetary policy said robert <unk> chief economist at northern trust co. in chicago
but economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat <unk> by the new numbers
the overall N N increase is serious in itself but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy the producer price index still increased by N N said <unk> <unk> an economist at the national association of manufacturers
but <unk> won <unk> chief economist at <unk> corp. in minneapolis blamed rising energy prices and the annual <unk> increase in car prices for most of the september jump
i would say this is not bad news this is a <unk> he said
the core rate is not really out of line
all year energy prices have <unk> the producer price index which measures changes in the prices producers receive for goods
inflation <unk> has fallen back from its <unk> pace last winter when a steep <unk> in world oil prices sent the index <unk> at <unk> annual rates
energy prices then plummeted through the summer causing the index to decline for three consecutive months
overall the index has climbed at a N N <unk> annual rate since the start of the year the labor department said
while far more <unk> than the pace at the beginning of the year that is still a <unk> rise than the N N increase for all of N
moreover this year 's good inflation news may have ended last month when energy prices <unk> up N N after <unk> N N in august
some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain
analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index but the N N climb was higher than most anticipated
i think the <unk> in inflation is going to continue for a few months said john <unk> chief economist at bell <unk> <unk> a washington economic <unk> firm
he predicted that inflation will moderate next year saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world-wide
but <unk> van <unk> president of the national association of <unk> said that last month 's rise is n't as bad an <unk> as the N N figure suggests
if you <unk> the data carefully the increase is <unk> in energy and motor vehicle prices rather than being a <unk> advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods he explained
<unk> car prices jumped N N in september after <unk> N N in august and declining in the late spring and summer
many analysts said the september increase was a one-time event coming as dealers introduced their N models
although all the price data were adjusted for normal seasonal <unk> car prices rose beyond the <unk> <unk> increase
prices for capital equipment rose a hefty N N in september while prices for home electronic equipment fell N N
food prices declined N N after <unk> N N in august
meanwhile the retail sales report showed that car sales rose N N in september to $ N billion
but at least part of the increase could have come from higher prices analysts said
sales at general merchandise stores rose N N after declining N N in august while sales of building materials fell N N after rising N N
producer prices for <unk> goods grew N N in september after dropping for three consecutive months
prices for crude goods an <unk> of raw materials jumped N N after declining N N in august and <unk> up N N in july
here are the labor department 's producer price <unk> N <unk> N for september before seasonal adjustment and the percentage changes from september N
<unk> financial corp. said it expects to report a loss of at least $ N million to $ N million for the third quarter
in the year-earlier period <unk> had net income of $ N but no per-share earnings
<unk> 's president and chief executive officer john <unk> said the loss <unk> from several factors
he said nonperforming assets rose to slightly more than $ N million from $ N million between june and september
approximately N N of the total <unk> of nonperforming commercial real estate assets
<unk> <unk> estimated that it will provide between $ N million and $ N million for credit losses in the third quarter
<unk> added that significant additional loan-loss provisions may be required by federal regulators as part of the current annual <unk> of city federal savings bank <unk> 's primary subsidiary based in <unk> <unk>
city federal operates N banking offices in new jersey and florida
mr. <unk> said <unk> will also mark its portfolio of high-yield corporate bonds to market as a result of federal legislation requiring that savings institutions <unk> themselves of such bonds
that action <unk> said will result in a charge against third-quarter results of approximately $ N million
<unk> also said it expects to <unk> its remaining mortgage loan <unk> operations outside its principal markets in new jersey and florida and as a result is taking a charge for discontinued operations
all these actions mr. <unk> said will result in a loss of $ N million to $ N million for the third quarter
he added however depending on the resolution of certain accounting issues relating to mortgages <unk> and the outcome of the annual <unk> of city federal currently in progress with <unk> to the appropriate level of loan loss reserves the total loss for the quarter could significantly exceed this range
<unk> savings bank said federal thrift regulators ordered it to <unk> dividend payments on its two classes of preferred stock indicating that regulators ' concerns about the troubled institution have <unk>
in a statement <unk> <unk> said the regulators cited the thrift 's operating losses and apparent losses in its junk-bond portfolio in <unk> the suspension of the dividends
regulators also ordered <unk> to stop buying back the preferred stock
david l. paul chairman and chief executive officer criticized the federal office of thrift <unk> which issued the <unk> saying it was <unk> and based on <unk> reasons
he said the thrift will try to get regulators to reverse the decision
the suspension of a preferred stock dividend is a serious step that <unk> that regulators have deep concerns about an institution 's health
in march regulators <unk> <unk> a troubled institution largely because of its big junk-bond holdings and its operating losses
in the same month the office of thrift <unk> ordered the institution to stop paying common stock dividends until its operations were on track
for the nine months ended june N <unk> had a net loss of $ N million compared with year-earlier net income of $ N million
<unk> which is florida 's largest thrift holds one of the largest junk-bond portfolios of any thrift in the nation
since april it has <unk> its high-yield bond holdings to about $ N million from $ N billion
mr. paul said only about $ N million of the current holdings are <unk> securities registered with the securities and exchange commission
the <unk> he said are commercial loan <unk> or private <unk> that are n't filed with the sec and do n't have a ready market
<unk> and regulators have been in a dispute over market <unk> for the junk bonds
the office of thrift <unk> has been <unk> <unk> to provide current market values for its holdings but <unk> has said it ca n't easily obtain such values because of the relative <unk> of the bonds and lack of a ready market
regulators have become increasingly <unk> about <unk> 's and other thrifts ' junk-bond holdings in light of the recent federal thrift bailout legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk-bond market
the legislation requires thrifts to <unk> themselves of junk bonds in the new <unk> regulatory climate
in american stock exchange composite trading friday <unk> common shares closed at $ N down N cents
in a statement friday mr. paul <unk> the regulators ' decision saying the thrift 's operating losses and apparent junk-bond losses have been substantially offset by gains in other activities of the bank
he also said substantial reserves have been set aside for possible losses from the junk bonds
in the third quarter for instance <unk> added $ N million to its general reserves
mr. paul said the regulators should instead move ahead with <unk> <unk> 's request to sell N of its N branches to great western bank a unit of great western financial corp. based in <unk> hills calif
the branch sale is the <unk> of <unk> 's strategy to <unk> itself into a traditional s&l from a <unk> institution that <unk> heavily on securities trading for profits according to mr. paul
most analysts and thrift executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction which was announced in july long before now
many <unk> the delay as an indication that regulators are skeptical about the proposal
branches and deposits can be sold at a premium in the event federal regulators take over an institution
<unk> however <unk> the branch sale saying it would bring in $ N million and reduce the thrift 's assets to $ N billion from $ N billion
it said the sale would give it positive <unk> capital of $ N million or about N N of assets from a negative $ N million as of sept. N thus bringing <unk> close to regulatory standards
<unk> said the branch sale would also reduce the company 's large amount of good will by about $ N million
critics however say the branch sale will make <unk> more <unk> than ever on <unk> deposits and junk bonds
mr. paul <unk> that he intends to further <unk> the size of <unk> by not <unk> more than $ N billion of <unk> certificates of deposit when they come due
the thrift is also working to <unk> its junk-bond portfolio by continuing to sell off the bonds and it plans to eventually place some of them in a separate affiliate as required under the new thrift law
on a recent saturday night in the <unk> of west germany 's most popular <unk> show a <unk> bet the host that she could name any of N different <unk> after just one <unk> while <unk>
the woman won the bet
but perhaps even more <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> make a bet <unk> <unk> the top <unk> in the country 's tv ratings sometimes <unk> as many as N N of west german households
as the N economic <unk> approaches europe 's <unk> <unk> have taken to the <unk> against american <unk> <unk> threatening to <unk> <unk> against such <unk> <unk> as dallas miami vice and <unk> law
but much of what the <unk> want to protect seems every bit as <unk> as what they are trying to keep out
the most <unk> opposition to american tv imports has come from french television and movie producers who have <unk> <unk> <unk> that a full N N of europe 's tv shows be produced in europe
so far the french have failed to win enough <unk> support to <unk>
a <unk> through the television <unk> and a few <unk> of the european television <unk> suggest one reason why
while there are some popular action and <unk> series few <unk> the high culture and <unk> production values one might expect
more european air time is filled with <unk> game shows variety hours movies and talk shows many of which are authorized <unk> of their american <unk>
one of france 's most popular saturday night programs features <unk> seeking out their <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk>
a <unk> game show has as its host a <unk> <unk> to be italian
one of italy 's favorite shows <unk> a <unk> variety show is so popular that <unk> <unk> to buy a <unk> product <unk> <unk> whose <unk> were <unk> each week by <unk> <unk> even though the product did n't exist
<unk> the <unk> <unk> on another typical evening of <unk> on <unk> <unk> a <unk> won a bet with the show 's host thomas <unk> that he could identify N german <unk> over the telephone
a <unk> <unk> u.s. <unk> to west germany richard <unk> also won a bet that someone could <unk> up $ N worth of quarters on a <unk> <unk>
mr. <unk> <unk> paid the <unk> as if he had lost <unk> to spend a day with west german foreign minister <unk> <unk> <unk> and selling their combined weight in <unk> <unk>
if this seems like pretty weak stuff around which to raise the <unk> barriers it may be because these shows need all the protection they can get
european programs usually target only their own local audience and often only a small portion of that
<unk> in germany or italy rarely make it even to france or great britain and almost never show up on u.s. screens
attempts to produce <unk> programs have generally resulted in <unk>
one annual <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> contest <unk> <unk> <unk> from each of N european countries has been described as the world 's most <unk> tv show
another <unk> <unk> <unk> where <unk> from <unk> european countries make <unk> of themselves <unk> <unk> <unk> is a hit in france
a <unk> <unk> under the title almost anything goes <unk> fast
for the most part what 's made here <unk> here and for good reason
the <unk> of the british <unk> the <unk> <unk> that are shown on u.s. public television as <unk> theater make up a relatively small part of british air time
most british programming is more of an acquired <unk>
there is for instance one man and his <unk> a <unk> contest among <unk> <unk>
also <unk> to the british are hours of <unk> <unk> even more hours of <unk> <unk> <unk> and still more hours of <unk> <unk>
european <unk> has had better though still mixed <unk>
the most popular such shows focus on narrow national concerns
a french <unk> of dallas called <unk> and set in a french <unk> had a good run in france which ended after the <unk> lead was injured in a <unk> auto accident
<unk> black forest <unk> a kind of german <unk> elsewhere set in a health <unk> is popular in germany and has spread into france
italy 's most popular series is a <unk> called la <unk> or the <unk> which <unk> the fight of an <unk> young <unk> in <unk> against the <unk>
it was <unk> news in italy earlier this year when the <unk> <unk> was <unk> down in the series
spain 's most popular <unk> this year was <unk> the story of an <unk> <unk>
the trend is pretty well established now that local programs are the most popular with american programs second says <unk> <unk> a former director of programs for the british broadcasting corp
given a choice everybody will watch a <unk> show
but frequently there is n't much choice
thus europe has begun the recent <unk> to produce more <unk> shows of its own programs with broader appeal
we 've <unk> got to start from <unk> to train writers and producers to make shows that other people will want to see concedes <unk> young head of britain 's national film <unk> school
while some in the u.s. contend that advertising is the <unk> of television here many believe that its absence is to blame for the european tv industry 's sluggish development
until recently national governments in europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising
since production costs were guaranteed it did n't matter that a program could n't be sold abroad or put into <unk> as most american programs are
but not much money was spent on the shows either a situation that encouraged <unk> talk and game shows while <unk> <unk> <unk>
now however commercial <unk> are coming to most european countries and at the same time <unk> and cable technology is <unk> rapidly
just last week <unk> authorized two commercial <unk> for the first time spain earlier began to allow commercial television <unk> its state <unk>
the result is a new and huge <unk> for programming
but perhaps to the <unk> of those calling for <unk> most of this <unk> is likely to be filled with the <unk> and most <unk> programming now available <unk> usually of shows made in the u.s.

the <unk> of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping and oil exploration activity is also down <unk> as many producers shift their <unk> to natural gas said ronald <unk> vice president for government and industry relations with <unk> 's parent <unk> energy inc
mr. <unk> said volume on <unk> 's system is down about N N since january and is expected to fall further making expansion <unk> until perhaps the <unk>
there has been a <unk> of the <unk> back to the gas side he said
many of canada 's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil and have <unk> their exploration and development <unk> <unk>
the number of active <unk> <unk> in canada is down N N from a year ago and the number of completed oil wells is down more than that due to the increasing focus on gas exploration said robert <unk> manager of crude oil with <unk> 's independent petroleum association of canada an industry group
mr. <unk> said the main reason for the production decline is <unk> output of light crude from mature conventional fields in western canada

nearly all of the crude oil that canada exports to the u.s. is <unk> on <unk> 's system whose main line runs from <unk> to major u.s. and canadian cities in the great <unk> region including chicago <unk> toronto and <unk>

it 's very much a growing concern
but when something is <unk> you learn to live with it he said
mr. <unk> <unk> that the delay of <unk> 's proposed expansion wo n't by itself increase u.s. <unk> on <unk> crude however since canadian imports are limited in any case by canada 's falling output

in the second quarter the <unk> had net income of $ N million or $ N a share including a pretax charge of $ N million related to the settlement of a suit on sales of $ N billion
the company said normal seasonal <unk> and lost orders caused by <unk> labor talks reduced shipments by N tons in the latest quarter compared with the second quarter
at the same time the <unk> business was hurt by continued increases in materials costs and repair and maintenance expenses as well as higher labor costs under its new contract
the <unk> business was hurt by reduced margins and start-up costs associated with its joseph t. <unk> & son unit
the company said it is beginning to see some <unk> improvements in both the <unk> and <unk> segments which should result in improved results for the fourth quarter
<unk> said its third-quarter results will be announced later this week

investors taking this as a sign that a broad industry slump was in the <unk> reacted by selling the company 's stock which lost $ N that day to close at $ N in national over-the-counter trading
but that was all of three months ago
last week microsoft said it expects revenue for its first quarter ended sept. N to increase N N
the announcement caused the company 's stock to surge $ N to close at $ N a share
microsoft 's surprising strength is one example of the difficulty facing investors looking for <unk> about the financial health of the computer firms
it 's hard to know what to expect at this point said peter <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk> & co
the industry <unk> <unk>
to <unk> mr. <unk> said that of the N <unk> firms he follows half will report for their most recent quarter earnings below last year 's results and half above those results
among those companies expected to have a down quarter are hewlett-packard co. <unk> corp. and sun <unk> inc. generally solid <unk> in the past
international business machines corp. also is expected to report disappointing results
apple computer inc. meanwhile is expected to show improved earnings for the period ended <unk>
another <unk> message comes from <unk> inc. a computer retailer
in july the company reported that <unk> sales of new personal computers from apple and ibm had resulted in net income more than doubling for its fourth quarter ended june N to $ N million or N cents a share
this month however <unk> warned investors that results for its first quarter ended sept. N had n't met expectations
the company said it expects earnings of N to N cents a share down from N cents a share in the year-earlier period
while the earnings picture <unk> observers say the major forces expected to shape the industry in the coming year are <unk>
companies will continue to war over standards
in computer publishing a battle over <unk> is <unk> <unk> systems inc. which sells software that controls the image produced by <unk> and displays
until recently <unk> had a <unk> on the market for image software but last month apple <unk> 's biggest customer and microsoft <unk>
now the two firms are <unk> on an alternative to <unk> 's approach and analysts say they are likely to carry ibm the biggest seller of personal computers along with them
the short-term outlook for <unk> 's business however appears strong
the company is beginning to ship a new software program that 's being <unk> as a <unk> for owners of <unk> <unk> sold by apple
the program is aimed at <unk> the quality of <unk> material
john <unk> <unk> 's chief executive officer said the mountain view calif. company has been <unk> N calls a day about the product since it was <unk> at a computer publishing conference several weeks ago

on the other hand the battle of the bus is expected to grow increasingly <unk>
a bus is the data highway within a computer
ibm is backing one type of bus called <unk> while the nine other leading computer makers including <unk> and compaq computer corp. have chosen another method
users do n't care about the bus said daniel <unk> an analyst at goldman sachs & co
he said apple 's family of <unk> computers for instance uses four different <unk> and no one seems to mind
the gap between winners and <unk> will grow
in personal computers apple compaq and ibm are expected to <unk> their hold on their business
at the same time <unk> firms will continue to lose ground
some <unk> competitors even may leave the personal computer business <unk>
<unk> technology for instance is considered a candidate to sell its troubled operation
<unk> has done well <unk> a distribution business but they have n't delivered products that sell said <unk> brown an analyst at prudential-bache securities
mr. brown estimates <unk> whose <unk> business is strong will report a loss of N cents a share for its quarter ended <unk>
<unk> makers will continue to eat away at the business of more traditional computer firms
<unk> powerful <unk> computers designed with one or more <unk> as their <unk> are expected to increasingly take on <unk> carried out by more expensive <unk> and mainframes
the guys that make traditional hardware are really being <unk> by <unk> machines said mr. <unk>
as a result of this trend longtime <unk> <unk> ibm and digital equipment corp. are <unk> to <unk> with <unk> systems of their own
but they will have to act quickly
mr. <unk> expects compaq to <unk> a family of <unk> personal computers later this year that are powerful enough to serve as the <unk> for communications within large networks of <unk> machines
a <unk> of new computer companies also has <unk> this <unk> market
population <unk> ends for <unk> states
<unk> is making a comeback
so are <unk> ohio and michigan
the population of all four states is on the <unk> according to new census bureau estimates following declines throughout the early 1980s
the gains to be sure are rather small
<unk> for instance saw its population grow by N people or N N between N and N the census bureau says
still even that modest increase is good news for a state that had n't grown at all since N
between N and N north <unk> was the only state in the <unk> to lose population a loss of N people
six of the N <unk> states have been growing steadily since N illinois kansas minnesota missouri south <unk> and wisconsin
the northeast has been holding its own in the population race
seven of nine states have grown each year since N including new york which lost N N of its population during the 1970s
and although pennsylvania and massachusetts suffered slight declines earlier in the decade they are growing again
at the same time several states in the south and west have had their own population turnaround
seven states that grew in the early 1980s are now losing population west virginia <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
overall though the south and west still <unk> the northeast and <unk> and <unk> states like florida and california ensure that the pattern will continue
but the growth gap between the sun <unk> and other <unk> has clearly started <unk>
more elderly maintain their independence
thanks to modern <unk> more couples are growing old together
and even after losing a <unk> more of the elderly are <unk> independent
a new census bureau study of the <unk> population shows that N N of people <unk> N to N were living with a <unk> in N up from N N in N
this does n't mean they 're less likely to live alone however
that share has remained at about N N since N
what has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with <unk> rather than with other <unk> such as children
in N N N of those <unk> N to N lived with <unk> other than <unk> down from N N in N
as people get even older many become <unk>
but even among those <unk> N and older the share living with a <unk> rose slightly to N N in N from N N in N
like their younger <unk> the older elderly are less likely to live with other <unk>
only N N of those <unk> N and older lived with <unk> other than <unk> in N down from N N in N
the <unk> of living alone beyond the age of N has increased to N N from N N
more people are remaining independent longer <unk> because they are better off <unk> and financially
<unk> <unk> most for the <unk>
many <unk> people place personal success and money above family
at least that 's what a survey by <unk> & young and <unk> <unk> <unk> indicates
two-thirds of respondents said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs while fewer than half said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families
being successful in <unk> and spending the money they make are top <unk> for this group
unlike most studies of the <unk> market this survey <unk> the <unk>
average household income for the <unk> was $ N and average net assets were reported as $ N
the goal was to learn about one of today 's <unk> income groups the <unk> class
although they represent only N N of the population they control nearly one-third of <unk> income
across the board these consumers value quality buy what they like rather than just what they need and <unk> products that are <unk>
despite their considerable <unk> and assets N N of the respondents in the study do n't feel financially secure and <unk> do n't feel that they have made it
<unk> percent do n't even feel they are financially well off
many of the <unk> are n't comfortable with themselves either
about N N do n't feel they 're more able than others
while <unk> feel some <unk> about being <unk> only N N give $ N or more to charity each year
<unk> percent <unk> <unk> services <unk> at the same time N N feel that in life one sometimes has to compromise one 's <unk>

the council 's action is yet another blow to a sport that its fans claim has been <unk> <unk> for years
obviously they 're not in <unk> with what 's going on says tom <unk> vice president of the national <unk> <unk> association
pool is hot in new york and chicago he <unk> where <unk> <unk> places are adding <unk>

or so it must seem to <unk> <unk> the veteran <unk> <unk> <unk> in a new abc <unk> <unk> on tuesday <unk> N p.m. edt
not only is mr. <unk> the star of <unk> <unk> he 's also the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> back to <unk> <unk> and he 's currently a man in hot water
here in <unk> language is the <unk> of mr. <unk> 's <unk> quoted first in the <unk> voice while he was a paid spokesman for the <unk> giuliani <unk> campaign and then in <unk> after he and the campaign <unk> company
mr. <unk> said that many <unk> voters feel guilty toward blacks so they support black candidates <unk>
he said that many black voters feel <unk> about racial discrimination so they too support black candidates <unk>
he said that <unk> have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice <unk>
of course mr. <unk> did not use <unk> language
as a <unk> of <unk> <unk> from the old days on the <unk> <unk> live television and the <unk> circuit mr. <unk> <unk> reached for the <unk>
he said <unk> were <unk> with <unk> and he called david dinkins mr. giuliani 's black <unk> a <unk> <unk> with a <unk>
if mr. <unk> had used less <unk> language to <unk> his <unk> analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow new <unk> would the water be quite so hot
it probably would because few or none of the people <unk> by mr. <unk> 's <unk> have <unk> to <unk> between the <unk> of his comments and the fact that he used <unk> language
in addition some of mr. <unk> 's critics have <unk> that his type of <unk> <unk> is itself a form of <unk>
for example the new york state counsel for the <unk> said that mr. <unk> is like a <unk>
people are fast leaving the place where he is stuck
these critics fail to <unk> between the type of <unk> <unk> that <unk> at <unk> another group such as polish <unk> and the type that is <unk> <unk> <unk> as well as <unk>
the <unk> typically is the <unk> of the <unk> and it was <unk> by both blacks and <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> stage as a means of <unk> their white and <unk> <unk> along with themselves
in the hands of a <unk> like <unk> <unk> this <unk> <unk> could cut both the <unk> and the audience to <unk>
but <unk> by a <unk> like <unk> <unk> it is a <unk> form of <unk>
why <unk>
because despite all the media <unk> about <unk> and politics not <unk> they are similar in one <unk> both can serve as <unk> for easing <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of groups in conflict
that 's why it 's dangerous to have <unk> thought police on college <unk> and elsewhere <unk> all critical <unk> of group differences
as <unk> <unk> wrote in the new york times just before the <unk> <unk> perhaps <unk> would not <unk> over with such <unk> if <unk> differences were allowed to <unk>
the question is if group <unk> still exist as <unk> they do and if mr. <unk> 's type of <unk> <unk> is <unk> then what other means do we have for letting off <unk>
do n't say the tv <unk> because that <unk> to be a <unk> that in its <unk> need to attract everybody and <unk> nobody <unk> politics more than it does <unk>
it is true that the best <unk> do allow group differences to <unk> <unk> vs. <unk> <unk> in <unk> children vs. <unk> in the <unk> show
but these are not the differences that make <unk>
in <unk> <unk> mr. <unk> plays <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an <unk> <unk> and mother of three against the <unk> of his mother <unk> <unk> and her <unk> michael <unk> <unk>
it 's worth noting that both <unk> <unk> are <unk>
at least they both speak with strong <unk> as do <unk> and <unk>
it could n't be more obvious that <unk> <unk> is being made from an old <unk>
and a safe one <unk> if the <unk> in question were between an <unk> <unk> and a member of the nation of <unk>
back in the <unk> the play and movie <unk> of <unk> 's <unk> rose made the theme of <unk> between the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> so popular that its author <unk> <unk> lost a <unk> suit on the <unk> that the <unk> has entered the public <unk>
and it has remained there as <unk> by its <unk> in a N cbs <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> whose sole <unk> was that it led to the <unk> <unk> of meredith <unk> and david <unk>
clearly the question with <unk> <unk> is not whether the <unk> will <unk> over but whether it will <unk> at all
so far the <unk> have been few and far between
part of the problem is the <unk> of all <unk> ever since the <unk> days of <unk> <unk> to <unk> about social issues
to some extent this <unk> <unk> <unk> the show tries to <unk> us about <unk> <unk> by <unk> them
for instance michael <unk> <unk> not because he 's a <unk> <unk> businessman but because he <unk> his <unk> job as a salesman in order to become a social worker
even more <unk> is the <unk> between <unk> <unk> and mr. <unk> 's <unk> <unk>
the best <unk> in the show <unk> at the beginning and the end and occasionally in the middle when mr. <unk> <unk> into his <unk> <unk> and starts <unk> out that <unk> <unk> <unk> to other people as well as to himself
but too often these <unk> lack <unk> because this <unk> like all <unk> is <unk> about <unk> mr. <unk> 's stock in trade <unk> differences
i 'm not <unk> that the producers start putting together <unk> about <unk> like the <unk> dispute over the <unk> <unk> at <unk>
that issue like racial <unk> in new york city will have to cool down not heat up before it can <unk>
but i am <unk> that they stop requiring mr. <unk> to <unk> his classic <unk> with some line about <unk> for other people that would sound <unk> on the <unk> of miss america
at your age <unk> you ought to know that you ca n't make <unk> without turning up the <unk>

the senate 's decision to approve a <unk> deficit-reduction bill without a capital-gains tax cut still leaves open the possibility of <unk> a gains tax reduction this year
late friday night the senate voted N to approve an estimated $ N billion measure that had been <unk> of hundreds of provisions that would have widened rather than narrowed the federal budget deficit
lawmakers <unk> <unk> the bill to <unk> criticism that it was <unk> with <unk> tax <unk> and spending increases
we 're putting a deficit-reduction bill back in the category of being a deficit-reduction bill said senate budget committee chairman james <unk> d. <unk>
but senate supporters of the <unk> legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through congress that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside including a capital-gains tax cut
in addition the <unk> deficit-reduction bill already passed by the house includes a capital-gains provision
house-senate negotiations are likely to begin at <unk> and last for a while
no one can predict exactly what will happen on the house side said senate minority leader robert <unk> r. <unk>
but he added i believe republicans and democrats will work together to get capital-gains reform this year
white house budget director richard darman told reporters yesterday that the administration would n't push to keep the capital-gains cut in the final version of the bill
we do n't need this as a way to get capital gains he said
house budget committee chairman <unk> <unk> d. calif said in an interview if that 's the signal that comes from the white house that will help a great deal
the senate 's decision was a setback for president bush and will make approval of a capital-gains tax cut less certain this year
opponents of the cut are playing <unk>
senate majority leader george mitchell d. <unk> said he was confident that any house-senate agreement on the deficit-reduction legislation would n't include a capital-gains tax cut
and a senior aide to the house ways and means committee where tax legislation <unk> said there are n't any plans to produce another tax bill that could carry a gains tax cut this year
one obvious place to <unk> a capital-gains tax cut and perhaps other popular items <unk> from the deficit-reduction bill is the legislation to raise the federal borrowing limit
such legislation must be enacted by the end of the month
the senate bill was <unk> back in an attempt to speed deficit-reduction through congress
because the legislation has n't been completed president bush has until <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> spending cuts <unk> by the <unk> deficit-reduction law
senators hope that the need to avoid those cuts will pressure the house to agree to the <unk> bill
the house appears reluctant to join the senators
a key is whether house republicans are willing to <unk> to their senate colleagues ' decision to drop many <unk> provisions
although i am encouraged by the senate action said chairman <unk> <unk> d. ill of the house ways and means committee it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the <unk> conference with the senate
another big question <unk> over the debate is what president bush thinks
he has been <unk> a <unk> bill without a guaranteed vote on his capital-gains tax cut
but republican senators saw no way to <unk> a <unk> <unk> and <unk> the N votes needed to win the capital-gains issue on the floor so they went ahead with the <unk> bill
the senate bill was <unk> of many popular though <unk> provisions a number of which are included in the <unk> bill
these include a <unk> initiative and <unk> of <unk> tax <unk> for <unk> housing and <unk> expenditures
also missing from the senate bill is the house 's repeal of a law called section N that <unk> companies to give <unk> workers comparable health benefits to top paid executives
one <unk> provision that was originally in the senate bill but was cut out because it lost money was the proposal by chairman lloyd <unk> d. texas of the senate finance committee to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts
mr. <unk> said he hopes the senate will consider that measure soon
to the <unk> of some doctors the bill dropped a plan passed by the finance committee that would have <unk> the entire <unk> system under <unk>
to the <unk> of many <unk> people efforts to boost <unk> funding especially in rural areas also were <unk>
asked why senators were giving up so much new mexico sen. <unk> <unk> the <unk> republican on the senate budget committee said we 're looking like <unk>
things had just gone too far
sen. <unk> said that the move required <unk> by every senator
it worked others said because there were no <unk> all <unk> provisions were <unk>
the senate also dropped a plan by its finance committee that would have increased the income <unk> beyond which senior citizens have their social security benefits reduced
in addition the bill dropped a plan to make permanent a N N <unk> tax on long-distance telephone calls
it no longer includes a plan that would have <unk> what remains of the <unk> method of accounting which is used by military contractors to reduce their tax burden
it also <unk> a provision that would have permitted corporations to use excess pension funds to pay health benefits for current <unk>
also <unk> was a <unk> increase in the maximum <unk> safety and health administration penalties which would have raised $ N million in fiscal N
a provision that would have made the social security administration an independent agency was <unk>
the approval of the senate bill was especially <unk> for sen. mitchell who had proposed the <unk>
mr. mitchell 's relations with budget director darman who pushed for a capital-gains cut to be added to the measure have been <unk> since mr. darman <unk> to <unk> the <unk> democrat and deal with other lawmakers earlier this year during a dispute over drug funding in the fiscal N <unk> spending bill
the deficit reduction bill <unk> $ N billion in tax increases in fiscal N and $ N billion over five years

my unemployment insurance ran out before i found a job i found <unk> and <unk> in many companies
the statistics quoted by the new census bureau report <unk> from N to N are out of date certainly as an average for the northeast and possibly for the rest of the country
i think what <unk> me most about the piece was that there seemed to be an underlying attitude to tell your readers all is well if you 're getting <unk> off do n't worry and if you 're <unk> it 's a seller 's market
to top it off you <unk> the <unk> showing the average number of months in a job search as time off
are you <unk>

moody 's investors service inc. said it <unk> its rating to <unk> from <unk> on less than $ N million of this thrift 's senior subordinated notes
the rating concern said franklin 's troubled <unk> record in the securities business was one reason for the <unk> citing the troubles at its <unk> <unk> subsidiary and the possible sale of other subsidiaries
they perhaps had concern that we were getting out of all these said franklin president <unk> h. hall
i think it was a little <unk> on their part
just when it seemed safe to go back into stocks wall street suffered another severe attack of <unk>
does this signal another black monday is coming
or is this an extraordinary buying opportunity just like oct. N N eventually turned out to be
here 's what several leading market experts and money managers say about friday 's action what <unk> next and what investors should do
joseph <unk>
i 'm the only one who said there would be an october <unk> all through late august and september says mr. <unk> once a widely followed market <unk> and still a well-known newsletter writer
everyone will tell you that this time is different from N he says
well in some ways it is different but <unk> it is just the same
if you 're a <unk> you <unk> the <unk>
right now they 're telling me to get the <unk> out and stay out
i see no major support until N
i see a possibility of going to N this month
mr. <unk> says he would n't even think of buying until at least N to N stocks have hit <unk> <unk> about N stocks hit new <unk> friday
most people he says have no idea what a <unk> pattern looks like
<unk> <unk>
a <unk> analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc. ms. <unk> had warned clients to take their money out of the market before the N crash
friday 's big drop she says was not a crash
this was an october <unk> like those that occurred in N and N
now as in those two years her stock market <unk> are positive
so she thinks the damage will be <unk> and <unk>
those <unk> <unk> one to four weeks and took the market N N down she says
this is exactly the same thing as far as i 'm concerned
thus she says if the dow jones industrial average dropped below N it would just be a <unk>
my advice is to buy
as she <unk> it the average stock now sells for about N times companies ' earnings
she says that ratio could climb to N given current interest rates and still be within the range of fair value
<unk> davis
friday 's fall marks the start of a bear market says mr. davis president of <unk> davis research inc
but mr. davis whose views are widely <unk> by money managers says he expects no <unk> crash
there was a <unk> combination in N he says
margin debt was at a record high
there was tremendous public <unk> for stock mutual funds
the main thing was portfolio insurance a <unk> trading system intended to protect an investor against losses
a hundred billion dollars in stock was subject to it
in N such selling contributed to a <unk> effect
today could even be an up day mr. davis says if major brokerage firms agree to <unk> from program trading
over the next several months though he says things look bad
i think the market will be <unk> down into november he says
we will probably have a year-end rally and then go down again
sort of a <unk> bear market
he expects the downturn to carry the dow jones industrial average down to around N <unk> next year
that would be a normal bear market he says
i guess that 's my forecast
<unk> g. <unk>
i do n't think the market is going through another october <unk>
i do n't think that 's the case at all says mr. <unk> a partner at goldman sachs & co. and chairman of goldman sachs asset management
mr. <unk> sees this as a good time to pick up <unk> but he does n't think there 's any need to <unk>
i expect the market to open weaker monday but then it should find some <unk>
he <unk> off several major differences between now and two years ago
unlike N interest rates have been falling this year
unlike N the dollar has been strong
and unlike N the economy does n't appear to be in any danger of <unk>
but the economy 's slower growth this year also means the outlook for corporate profits is n't good he says
so it 's a very mixed <unk>
thus he <unk> this is not a good environment to be fully invested in stocks
if i had come into friday on margin or with very little cash in the portfolios i would not do any buying
but we came into friday with a conservative portfolio so i would look to do some modest buying on behalf of clients
we 're going to look for some of the <unk> companies that got <unk> friday
john kenneth <unk>
this is the latest <unk> of the capacity of the financial community for <unk> <unk> says mr. <unk> an economist
i see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond <unk> he says
the <unk> of junk bonds and takeovers has <unk> a lot of <unk> securities in the hands of investors and <unk> the corporations that are the <unk> of takeovers or <unk> takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity
this has both made investors <unk> and the corporations more vulnerable
nevertheless he says a <unk> does n't appear likely
there is more <unk> in the economy at large than we <unk> <unk> he says
it takes more error now to have a major <unk> than back in the <unk> much as the financial community and the government may try
<unk> <unk>
new york money manager <unk> <unk> an expert at <unk> takeover candidates says that takeovers are n't totally gone
companies are still going to buy companies around the world he says
<unk> are ford looking at jaguar <unk> looking at lin broadcasting
these <unk> of takeovers do n't require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them so mr. <unk> figures they will continue
the market was up N N since president bush took office mr. <unk> says so a <unk> was to be expected
he thinks another crash is unlikely and says he was <unk> at selected stocks during friday 's plunge
stocks that were <unk> out just on an emotional basis are a great opportunity this week for guys like me he says
jim <unk>
it seems to me that this is the <unk> that has finally <unk> the <unk> says mr. <unk> a professor of finance at columbia university and former <unk> of one of the most successful <unk> funds in history <unk> fund
he sees economic problems financial problems ahead for the u.s. with a fairly strong possibility of a recession
friday you could n't sell dollars he says
dealers would give you a <unk> but then <unk> to make the trade
if the dollar <unk> weak he says that will add to <unk> pressures in the u.s. and make it hard for the federal reserve board to ease interest rates very much
mr. <unk> wo n't decide what to do today until he sees how the london and tokyo markets go
he <unk> that investors sell <unk> stocks but <unk> on to some other stocks especially utilities which often do well during periods of economic weakness
frank <unk>
many people now claim to have predicted the N crash
<unk> newsletter writer <unk> <unk> <unk> actually did it he stated in writing in september N that the dow jones industrial average was likely to decline about N points the following month
mr. <unk> says what <unk> now will <unk> a good deal on the federal reserve board
if it <unk> cuts the discount rate it charges on loans to banks he says that could quiet things down
if not we could go to N very soon
frank w. <unk>
stock prices would still have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks says mr. <unk> president and managing director of <unk> investment management inc. in cincinnati
<unk> which manages about $ N billion drew <unk> criticism from many clients earlier this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus <unk> a strong rally
<unk> is keeping its money entirely in cash <unk> primarily u.s. treasury bills
<unk> probably are the right place to be he says
regarding the oct. N letter to the editor from rep. tom <unk> chairman of the house subcommittee on employment and housing <unk>
N that your sept. N editorial <unk> committees was <unk> <unk> and <unk> misleading
i thought your editorial was <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
N that mr. <unk> supported the rights of the witnesses to take the fifth amendment
yes he did
as i watched him on <unk> i heard him speak those <unk> words about the bill of rights which he <unk> from the <unk> of the hearings
he did <unk> those <unk> <unk> several times as an indication of his support for the constitution
he used about N words <unk> the witnesses ' constitutional rights
unfortunately by my <unk> guess he used better than N words <unk> <unk> on the witnesses for <unk> the fifth
he <unk> his <unk> of constitutional <unk> between large <unk> of <unk> <unk>
as your editorial <unk> pointed out samuel <unk> former hud secretary and <unk> <unk> mr. <unk> 's former aide are currently being held up to <unk> for taking the fifth amendment
that certainly is not the supposed <unk> reading indicated by mr. <unk>
N that his committee does not deal with any possible criminal activity at hud
my colleagues and i fully realize we are not a court <unk>
<unk> <unk>
by any reasonable man <unk> mr. <unk> and his colleagues have a whole <unk> of people tried and convicted
apparently their <unk> is in
right now they 're pursuing evidence
that 's not a bad way to proceed just somewhat different from standard american practice
how was that practice <unk> to when i was in school
<unk> yes something called a star chamber
of course mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change
no doubt that 's <unk> true
everything that mr. <unk> says in his letter is <unk> true
he 's right about his subcommittee 's <unk> when it comes to <unk> information from prior hud officials
but if his <unk> of <unk> is true why is his investigation so <unk> as to identify criminal activity
why not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and <unk>
such as what happened when congress wanted to know about $ N <unk> seats or whatever they <unk> cost
no mr. <unk> 's complaints simply wo n't <unk>
N that the journal <unk> the <unk> fraud waste <unk> <unk> and <unk> of the public that took place while mr. <unk> was secretary of hud <unk> and so <unk>
no to my mind the journal did not defend <unk> fraud waste <unk> <unk> and <unk> of the public trust
it <unk> appropriate constitutional <unk> and practical common sense
the problem which the journal so <unk> pointed out in a number of articles is not the <unk> of mr. <unk> who after all is really a bit player on the stage but the attempt by congress to <unk> itself into a <unk> body
of course we 've also got a <unk> that seeks the same <unk>
the system is the problem not an individual member
individuals can always have their hands <unk>
it 's when such <unk> does n't <unk> that we 've got trouble
i do not by any means defend hud management
but i think the kind of congressional investigation that has been <unk> is a far greater danger to american <unk> of <unk> and freedom than any <unk> and yes maybe <unk> within hud could possibly generate
the last time i saw a similar congressional hearing was when <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> did his work
raymond <unk>
<unk> <unk>
i <unk> with the statement by mr. <unk> that one should not draw an <unk> <unk> against former hud officials who <unk> their fifth amendment <unk> against <unk> in congressional hearings
the fifth amendment states in <unk> part that no person <unk> be <unk> in any criminal case to be a witness against himself
this <unk> against <unk> <unk> the <unk> of an <unk> <unk> against a criminal <unk> who <unk> not to <unk>
thus in a criminal case a prosecutor can not comment on a <unk> 's failure to <unk> nor can the <unk> be <unk> to take the stand as a witness thus <unk> him to take the fifth
the <unk> however has been limited in <unk> with its <unk> language to protect the <unk> in criminal matters only
the supreme court and some states have specifically <unk> that the fifth amendment does not <unk> the <unk> where the <unk> is claimed by a party to a civil cause
<unk> v. <unk> N u.s. N N
thus in a civil case a <unk> may be called as a witness he may be forced to <unk> or take the fifth and his taking of the fifth may permit the <unk> of an <unk> <unk> against him in the civil matter
he may take the fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good <unk> and <unk> belief that his <unk> may subject him to criminal <unk>
allowing the <unk> to take the fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to <unk> to <unk> where one 's <unk> <unk> him in the civil matter but because the <unk> in the civil matter could be <unk> used against him in a subsequent criminal <unk>
<unk> the risk of such <unk> a court may order the <unk> to <unk>
thus when mr. <unk> asserted the fifth in a <unk> <unk> particularly after <unk> <unk> extensive advice from legal counsel one must <unk> that he held a <unk> <unk> belief that his <unk> could be used against him in a subsequent criminal <unk>
the subcommittee congress and the american public have every right to draw the <unk> <unk> and to <unk> with mr. <unk> 's own belief that his <unk> could help <unk> him of a crime
<unk> the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> congressional hearing does not <unk> the fifth amendment <unk> against <unk>
<unk> s. <unk> <unk>
<unk> park <unk>
it was friday the <unk> and the stock market plummeted nearly N points
just a <unk>

chase manhattan bank chairman <unk> <unk> is a conservative banker and a loyal republican but on friday morning he had few kind words for president bush 's economic <unk>
there are some very significant issues out there such as the fiscal deficit the trade deficit our relations with japan that have to be the subject of major <unk> he said in an interview
i 'd like to see that initiative and i have n't
there is n't a big shot an <unk>
a few hours later the stock market dropped N points
politicians tried to <unk> each other for the blame although many analysts doubt that washington was <unk> responsible for wall street 's <unk>
but mr. <unk> 's comments make one thing clear some on wall street wonder if anyone is in charge of economic policy
consider this
by N p.m. <unk> president bush must order $ N billion of <unk> <unk> cuts in government spending to <unk> with the <unk> budget law
the cuts are necessary because congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a <unk> bill
we simply do n't have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices house budget committee chairman <unk> <unk> d. calif said yesterday on nbc news 's meet the press
for the last two weeks the bush administration and the federal reserve have been engaged in a <unk> battle over international economic policy
the administration has been trying to push the dollar lower the fed has been <unk>
one of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary <unk> between the treasury department and the federal reserve board said lawrence <unk> a bear stearns & co. economist on abc 's this week
the administration has sent out <unk> <unk> about its response to a recent <unk> of airline takeovers
last month transportation secretary sam <unk> forced <unk> airlines to reduce a stake held by <unk> royal dutch airlines
but he has since run into opposition from the treasury and the white house over that decision
and he has kept <unk> on how his decision might affect a bid for united airlines which includes a big stake by british airways plc
some analysts say uncertainty about washington 's <unk> policy was one reason that financing for the united airlines takeover fell through the event that triggered the market drop
in many ways the <unk> to friday 's stock decline is <unk> similar to that of october N 's <unk> crash
then as now the budget debate was behind schedule and <unk> spending cuts were within days of taking hold
the treasury was <unk> in a battle over international economic policy although at that time it was with west german officials rather than the federal reserve
and concern about official actions aimed at takeovers then by the <unk> house ways and means committee rather than the transportation department were making markets nervous
the N crash brought the reagan administration and democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget <unk> resulting in a two-year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $ N billion even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $ N billion during that period
but <unk> further <unk> in the market this week a similar outcome does n't seem likely this year
lawmakers and administration officials agree that friday 's drop by itself is n't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit-reduction agreement that would be more serious and more <unk> than last spring 's <unk> plan which still is n't fully <unk>
one of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely to come about is that as everyone learned in N the economy and the market can <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
everybody thought we were looking at a <unk> of N that we were looking at a recession rep. <unk> said yesterday in an interview
that did not happen
they learned they could <unk> it without much problem
but administration officials privately agree with mr. <unk> who said a <unk> drop this week is going to force the president and congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy
in that case there will be plenty of blame to go around
there is an underlying concern on the part of the american people and there should be that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that congress has been <unk> to cut what the administration asked us to cut said senate finance committee chairman lloyd <unk> d. texas
nevertheless it clearly will take more than friday 's <unk> decline to <unk> the <unk> <unk> that have developed between lawmakers and white house budget director richard darman over the capital-gains fight
hill democrats are particularly angry over mr. bush 's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of april 's budget accord and his <unk> on <unk> it with the deficit-reduction legislation
there is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply did n't live up to this year 's deal senate majority leader george mitchell d. <unk> said yesterday on cbs news 's face the nation
during last week 's <unk> on the <unk> bill and the capital-gains issue there were signs that senate republicans and the administration were at odds
at the very moment that senate republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit-reduction legislation white house spokesman <unk> fitzwater told reporters that it was the president 's policy to include it
when an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation <unk> sen. bob <unk> the <unk> gop member of the <unk> senate finance committee <unk> it
asked if the administration agreed he <unk> <unk> the <unk> will have to speak for itself
friday 's market <unk> could <unk> action on <unk> the house and senate <unk> of the deficit-reduction measure a process that is n't expected to begin until tomorrow at the <unk>
senate republicans expressed the hope that the house would follow the lead of the senate which on friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax <unk> that would have increased the fiscal N deficit
the market needs a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction and the best way to do that is for the house of representatives to strip their bill of similar provisions sen. <unk> <unk> r. <unk> said yesterday
the white house office of management and budget whose calculations determine whether the <unk> targets are met estimated that the <unk> deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal N <unk> by $ N billion almost half of the congressional budget office 's estimate of $ N billion
rep. <unk> said that <unk> 's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent <unk> cuts but added we 're getting very close to the margins here
no one in washington was willing to take the blame for <unk> friday 's drop in the stock market
but some players were quick to <unk> the moment
before the sun had set on friday richard <unk> the <unk> chief economist of the u.s. chamber of commerce issued a statement <unk> the drop in stock prices to the senate decision to <unk> action on capital gains
investors who had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time to sell were <unk> he said
there have been many <unk> reasons advanced to support a capital-gains tax cut sen. mitchell said during his television <unk> but i suggest that is perhaps more than any of the others

some critics however say its ability to run <unk> programs is restricted by a limited memory
<unk> computer corp. meanwhile has introduced a much more sophisticated <unk> that can run lotus N and other sophisticated software programs but costs five times as much
at stake is what <unk> <unk> compaq 's president of north america operations calls the <unk> <unk> of the computer industry the search for a real computer in a package so small you can take it <unk>
the market is so new nobody knows yet how big it can be
i 've had a lot of people trying to sell me services to find out how big it is says tom <unk> director of marketing for <unk>
whether it 's $ N billion or $ N billion it does n't matter
it 's huge
consider the growth of <unk> which now <unk> N N of all personal computer sales
<unk> generally anything under N <unk> have become the <unk> personal computer segment with sales doubling this year
<unk> to that demand however has led to a variety of <unk>
making computers smaller often means <unk> memory
it also has <unk> use of the faster more powerful <unk> found in increasing numbers of desktop machines
size and weight <unk> also have limited screen displays
the competitive <unk> can get pretty <unk> at times
a <unk> spokesman for example <unk> the <unk> portfolio because it requires three <unk> while the <unk> needs only two
both <unk> are dismissed by <unk> makers who argue that they 're too small a problem <unk> also <unk> in focus groups admits <unk> <unk> director of marketing
<unk> trying to avoid the <unk> <unk> responded with the <unk> line the <unk> <unk> a very big computer
despite the <unk> few question the <unk> of the move to small machines that do n't make <unk>
toward that end experts say the real battle will take place between <unk> players like <unk> <unk> and now compaq
compaq 's new machines are considered a direct threat to start-up firms like <unk> inc. which introduced in june a computer that like compaq 's uses an intel N <unk> and has a hard disk drive
but the <unk> product is twice as heavy and costs more than compaq 's
compaq 's announcement also <unk> trouble for <unk> which last year had N N of the u.s. <unk> market but recently agreed to sell its computer business to <unk> <unk> machines <unk> the french <unk> computer maker
<unk> holders will vote in december on the proposed $ N million sale a price that could <unk> because it is <unk> to <unk> 's share and sales
compaq is already taking aim at <unk> 's market share
<unk> <unk> compaq 's president and chief executive officer notes <unk> that <unk> 's $ N <unk> uses an <unk> <unk> <unk> disk <unk> compaq 's new machines use the more common N <unk> disk
john p. frank president of <unk> data systems simply <unk> off such criticism noting that N <unk> <unk> were also <unk> when they first replaced <unk> <unk>
we do n't look at it as not being a standard we look at it as a new standard he <unk>
analysts do n't see it that way
i ca n't <unk> that you 'll talk to anyone who wo n't tell you this is <unk> for compaq and a <unk> for everyone else says gene <unk> president of professional marketing management inc
adds bill <unk> senior industry analyst for <unk> a <unk> market research firm we <unk> think that these are very hot products
the problem compaq is going to have is that they wo n't be able to make enough of them
compaq 's machines include the N <unk> <unk> disk drive a <unk> screen that is only <unk> <unk> and an internal expansion <unk> for a <unk> in other words almost all the <unk> of a typical office machine
others <unk> will follow but most analysts believe compaq has at least a six-month lead on the competition
<unk> 's line of <unk> for example features the <unk> which is in the same weight class but is much slower and has less memory and the <unk> which also uses a N <unk> but which <unk> almost twice as much and is three times the size
a third model <unk> in japan may hit the u.s. by the end of the first quarter of N but by then analysts say compaq will have established itself as one of three major players
what about big blue
international business machines corp. analysts say has been <unk> twice in trying to enter the <unk> market and shows no signs of trying to get into <unk> <unk> soon

gm said it still is talking with jaguar about acquiring a minority interest
investors who bought stock with borrowed money that is on margin may be more worried than most following friday 's market drop
that 's because their brokers can require them to sell some shares or put up more cash to <unk> the <unk> backing their loans
in october N these margin calls were thought to have contributed to the downward <unk> of the stock market
typically a margin call <unk> when the price of a stock falls below N N of its original value
if the investor does n't put up the extra cash to <unk> the call the brokerage firm may begin <unk> the securities
but some big brokerage firms said they do n't expect major problems as a result of margin calls
margin calls since friday have been higher than usual but reasonable a spokesman for shearson lehman hutton inc. said
merrill lynch & co. officials do n't expect margin calls to be as big a factor as in N because fewer individual investors are buying stock on margin a spokesman said
hugo <unk> senior vice president at charles <unk> corp. the san <unk> discount brokerage firm said he did n't expect any immediate problems with margin calls for <unk> customers
he said <unk> had increased margin requirements so customers have more of a <unk>
he added we learned a <unk> in N about volatility

the <unk> city n.y. <unk> company said it wo n't <unk> contracts with <unk> inc. 's <unk> airlines unit pan am corp. 's pan american world airways unit and <unk> airlines at the end of this year
but it remains involved in programs with amr corp. 's american airlines unit and delta air lines
industry estimates put <unk> 's annual cost of all five programs at between $ N million and $ N million
a spokesman for <unk> would n't <unk> the costs but said the three airlines being dropped account for far less than half of the total
budget <unk> a car corp. of chicago and national car <unk> systems inc. of minneapolis both said they had no plans to follow suit
in fact budget indicated it saw some benefit to <unk> involved in these programs in which <unk> earn <unk> miles and <unk> can get <unk> <unk>
i can not see how this news by <unk> and <unk> can not benefit budget 's programs said bob <unk> budget 's vice president marketing planning
<unk> and <unk> are two of the five airlines with which budget has agreements
national also <unk> in the <unk> <unk> program along with four other airlines including delta and usair group inc. 's usair unit
a month ago <unk> of park <unk> n.j. said that it would drop its marketing agreements at year end with delta america west and texas air corp. 's continental airlines and eastern airlines and that <unk> with american airlines ual inc 's united airlines and usair also would be ended <unk> after dec. N
at the time <unk> said its annual fees to those airlines <unk> to $ N million and that the value of <unk> <unk> topped $ N million
analysts and competitors however doubt the numbers were that high
budget said its <unk> costs are substantially below <unk> 's level
robert d. <unk> <unk> vice president of marketing said the <unk> and costs attached to <unk> programs have significantly <unk> their value
this year has been difficult for both <unk> and <unk> said charles <unk> <unk> industry analyst at alex brown & sons
they 've been looking to get their costs down and this is a fairly <unk> way to do it he said
cbs inc. is cutting the <unk> <unk> show down to one hour from its current N minutes
cbs <unk> the move was n't a setback for the program which is the network 's first <unk> into the <unk> talk show <unk> since N
i have every <unk> of making this the best possible show and having it run one hour is the best way to it said <unk> <unk> who was named vice president of late night entertainment in august
this will raise the energy level of the show
cbs will continue to program <unk> shows to follow the <unk> hour
but cbs news will extend its <unk> <unk> by N minutes and begin at N a.m
the show despite a promising start has slipped badly in the weekly ratings as compiled by <unk> <unk> co. <unk> far below <unk> on nbc a unit of general electric co. and <unk> on <unk> a unit of capital <unk> inc
further <unk> the <unk> audience is the addition of the <unk> hall show <unk> by paramount communications inc
<unk> computers inc. preparing to fight with international business machines corp. for a piece of the mainframe business said it expects to post higher revenue and earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter ended sept. N
<unk> said it expects to report revenue of about $ N million and earnings of N cents to N cents a share
the results which are in line with analysts ' estimates reflect a continued improvement in our u.s. business said james <unk> <unk> 's chief executive officer
in the year-earlier period <unk> reported net income of $ N million or N cents a share on revenue of $ N million
<unk> expects to report the full results for the quarter next week
analysts have predicted that the <unk> calif. company will report revenue of $ N million to $ N million and earnings of N cents to N cents a share
<unk> on the results for the quarter mr. <unk> said the strength of the company 's domestic business came as a surprise to him noting that sales in every region of the u.s. exceeded our plan
the company 's u.s. performance was helped by a record quarter for new customers he said
<unk> makes <unk> computers machines with <unk> <unk> systems that run stock exchanges networks of <unk> <unk> and other complex computer systems
tomorrow the company is scheduled to announce its most powerful computer ever which for the first time will bring it into direct competition with makers of mainframe computers
<unk> 's new <unk> computer is called <unk>
prices for the machine which can come in various <unk> are $ N million to $ N million
analysts expect the new computer to <unk> a hefty <unk> of business away from ibm the longtime leader in mainframes
we believe they could <unk> perhaps two to three billion dollars from ibm over the next few years said george <unk> an analyst at the <unk> group
that will <unk> <unk> 's growth
i 'd be <unk> if the company grew by less than N N next year said john <unk> an analyst at goldman sachs & co
ibm is expected to respond to <unk> 's <unk> by discounting its own mainframes which analysts say are roughly three times the price of a comparable system from <unk>
obviously ibm can give bigger <unk> to users immediately said mr. <unk>
but mr. <unk> questions whether that will be enough to stop <unk> 's first mainframe from taking on some of the <unk> that large organizations previously sought from big blue 's machines
the answer is n't price reductions but new systems he said
nevertheless <unk> faces a variety of challenges the biggest being that customers generally view the company 's computers as <unk> to ibm 's mainframes
even mr. <unk> is reluctant to <unk> this notion <unk> that <unk> 's new machines are n't <unk> for ibm 's mainframes
we 're after a little bigger <unk> he said
do n't jump yet
the stock market 's <unk> may turn out to be good news for the economy
in one wild hour of trading the market managed to <unk> what the bush administration has been trying to do <unk> for weeks
it is <unk> the federal reserve to ease its <unk> on credit and it took the wind out of a previously <unk> dollar
the resulting decline in interest rates and the value of the dollar could <unk> american business indeed the entire economy
this may sound <unk> optimistic
after all until a few years ago the stock market was viewed as a <unk> of the national economy
when it went down by all <unk> the economy followed
that has changed partly because the two years following the worst stock-market plunge in history have been <unk> comfortable
the N crash was a false <unk> however you view it says university of chicago economist <unk> <unk>
the market seems increasingly <unk> from the rest of the nation
its <unk> ca n't be <unk> to fundamental business conditions nor do they appear to <unk> major <unk> in the economy
the market today has a life of its own john <unk> chairman of international business machines corp. said saturday
there 's nothing <unk> about this kind of action
of course the health of the economy will be threatened if the market continues to <unk> this week
sharply falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth damage business confidence and <unk> the foreign investors upon whom the u.s. now <unk> for financial <unk>
the financial-services industry was battered by the N crash
what 's more although the stock market is far less <unk> today than two years ago the u.s. economy is weaker
growth is slower
profits are <unk>
debt <unk> are <unk>
but if the stock market does n't continue to <unk> the <unk> effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well <unk>
the fed which until friday had been <unk> moves to ease credit is now <unk> to <unk> money into the economy if needed to <unk> the markets
fed officials may <unk> that this does n't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest-rate policies
but the experience of the N crash suggests the fed is likely to bring down short-term interest rates in its effort to <unk> markets
<unk> the fed 's move money traders lowered a key interest rate known as the federal funds rate to N N late friday down from N N the day before
<unk> movements in the rate which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans are usually among the few visible <unk> that the fed leaves on the monetary markets
the dollar also began to decline friday as the stock market 's plunge caused some investors to <unk> their desire to invest in the u.s.
treasury officials have been <unk> for months that the dollar 's strength was out of <unk> with economic fundamentals threatening to <unk> the export <unk> that has sustained manufacturers for several years
the market drop has now apparently convinced foreign investors that the treasury was right about the <unk> dollar
a modest drop in the dollar only a modest one mind you would be <unk> by the u.s.
that was n't the case in N when the dollar was so weak that some economists and government officials seriously worried that it might collapse producing panic among foreign investors and <unk> the flow of foreign capital to the u.s.
another big difference between N and N is n't so <unk>
in the third quarter of N the economy <unk> at an <unk> annual rate of N N
the consensus among economists is that it grew a much more sluggish N N in the third quarter of N which ended two weeks ago
the plunge in stock prices is happening at a time when the economy has already slowed down says economist lawrence <unk> of <unk> group a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> company
a lot of <unk> demand is gone
consumer spending did drop in the months following black monday N but only slightly and for a short period of time recalls mr. <unk> a longtime student of business <unk>
that was offset by strength elsewhere
the effects were much less severe and less <unk> than some had <unk> or expected
today he <unk> exports and business investment spending may be <unk> to pick up the <unk> if stock prices <unk> this week and if consumers <unk> in reaction
what 's more the corporate borrowing <unk> has n't <unk> in the past two years
we 've had two more years of significant <unk> of debt just at the time when earnings are being squeezed mr. <unk> notes
the more a company <unk> on borrowed money the greater its <unk> to an economic slowdown
a company with a strong balance sheet can <unk> an <unk> storm a highly leveraged company may end up in bankruptcy court
the fed of course knows that very well <unk> its <unk> to <unk> credit into the economy this morning
but in the process the fed risks <unk> inflation
even before friday 's events harvard university economist <unk> <unk> was <unk> that the fed wo n't be able to live up to its tough words on eliminating inflation because of its responsibility to protect <unk> financial markets banks and highly leveraged corporations
the biggest threat on the economic <unk> right now is n't recession he reasons it 's an <unk> of <unk> inflation
in the end the N collapse suggested the economy does n't move in <unk> with stock prices
the economy does however <unk> on the confidence of businesses consumers and foreign investors
a panic on wall street does n't exactly <unk> confidence
<unk> suggested that consumer confidence was high before friday
a <unk> drop is n't likely to make much of a <unk> <unk> that a few times over though and it will
if the <unk> of executives <unk> saturday at hot <unk> va. for the business council meetings are typical business leaders were n't <unk> <unk> by friday 's decline
and if foreign investors become a <unk> more cautious well the dollar 's recent strength suggests that the u.s. can stand it
on the bottom line the most <unk> fact for the economic outlook is that we 've been through this before
two years ago about the only point of comparison was the N crash and the subsequent <unk>
the <unk> had a <unk> audience
the <unk> that followed black monday <unk> a more optimistic view today
at the very least the <unk> here is taking <unk> from the nation 's success in handling the last <unk>
as sen. lloyd <unk> d. texas <unk> yesterday the fed avoided a <unk> last time
they are more sophisticated this time
the chemical industry is expected to report that profits <unk> in the third quarter because of <unk> prices in the commodity end of the business

first boston corp. projects that N of the N companies it follows will report lower profit
most of the N have big <unk> operations
still some industry giants are expected to report continuing gains largely because so much of their business is outside commodity chemicals
<unk> <unk> co. is thought to have had steady profit growth in white <unk> <unk> and <unk>
moreover the <unk> <unk> company is helped when prices <unk> on the commodity chemicals it buys for its own production needs such as <unk>
analysts are divided over whether <unk> <unk> will report much of a gain in the latest quarter from its <unk> inc. oil company

the st. <unk> company is expected to report again that losses in its <unk> <unk> & co. pharmaceutical business are <unk>
<unk> continued to operate in the red through the first half of the year but <unk> has said it expects <unk> to post a profit for all of N
most estimates for <unk> run between $ N and $ N a share
a year ago the company posted third-quarter profit of $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N billion
<unk> declined to comment
but the <unk> producers are caught on the <unk> of a pricing cycle
by some accounts on wall street and in the industry the <unk> reductions are near an end which may <unk> <unk> demand
but <unk> say growing production capacity could keep pressure on prices into the early 1990s
in the latest quarter at least profit is expected to fall sharply
for <unk> inc. how far down it is we do n't know says <unk> <unk> at salomon brothers
the projections are in the neighborhood of N cents a share to N cents compared with a restated $ N a share a year earlier when profit was $ N million on sales of $ N million
<unk> faces lower prices for its <unk> product <unk> while it goes forward with a heavy capital investment program to bolster its raw material supply and develop new uses for <unk> whose markets include the <unk> and automobile industries

<unk> assurances of france gave details of its financing plans for its proposed $ N billion acquisition of farmers group inc. in <unk> filings with insurance regulators in the nine u.s. states where farmers operates
the proposed acquisition is part of sir james <unk> 's <unk> takeover attempt for b.a.t industries plc the british tobacco retailing paper and financial services concern that is parent of los angeles-based farmers
in an attempt to <unk> u.s. regulators ' concern over a <unk> acquisition of farmers sir james in august agreed to sell farmers to <unk> if he is successful in acquiring b.a.t
as part of the agreement <unk> agreed to invest $ N billion in <unk> investments ltd. sir james 's acquisition vehicle
of the total $ N billion to be paid to <unk> by <unk> about $ N billion will come from available resources of <unk> 's parent <unk> group $ N billion will be in the form of notes issued by <unk> and the remaining $ N billion will be in long-term bank loans
in an interview thursday <unk> <unk> chairman and chief executive officer of <unk> said his group has already obtained assurances from a group of banks led by <unk> <unk> de paribas that they can provide the loan portion of the financing
the other banking companies in the group are credit <unk> societe <unk> bankamerica corp. and citicorp he said
mr. <unk> said <unk> group has more than $ N billion of <unk> assets that we can and will sell to help pay off debt from the acquisition
he said the assets to be sold would be <unk> assets including a beer company and a real estate firm and would n't include any pieces of farmers
we wo n't put any burden on farmers he said
the <unk> filings also point out that under a new agreement <unk> has an <unk> obligation to sell farmers to <unk> upon an acquisition of b.a.t
we hope that with what we did the regulators will not need to <unk> <unk> and they can directly look at the agreement with us because <unk> wo n't be an owner of farmers at <unk> mr. <unk> said
any change of control in farmers needs approval of the insurance <unk> in the nine states where farmers and its related companies are <unk>
the <unk> filings were required because of the new agreement between <unk> and <unk> and to reflect the <unk> that sir james received last month under british takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition
<unk> dropped its initial # N billion $ N billion takeover bid after it received the <unk> but said it would launch a new bid if and when the <unk> sale of farmers to <unk> receives regulatory approval
a spokesman for b.a.t said of the <unk> filings that it would appear that nothing <unk> has changed
the new financing structure is still a <unk> leveraged one and <unk> still plans to take out N N of farmers ' earnings as dividends to service their debt
that dividend is almost double the N N currently taken out of farmers by b.a.t the spokesman added
it would have severe implications for farmers ' policy holders
to fend off sir james 's advances b.a.t has proposed a <unk> restructuring that would <unk> it to a tobacco and financial services concern
dismal sales at general motors corp. <unk> the u.s. car and truck market down below year-ago levels in early october the first sales period of the N model year
the eight major domestic auto makers sold N north <unk> cars in the first N days of october a N N drop from a year earlier

overall sales of all <unk> vehicles fell N N from a year ago

<unk> sales were n't available the cars are imported and <unk> reports their sales only at <unk>
the sales drop for the no. N car maker may have been caused in part by the end in september of dealer incentives that gm offered in addition to consumer <unk> and <unk> financing a company spokesman said
last year gm had a different program in place that continued <unk> dealers until all the N models had been sold
aside from gm other car makers posted generally mixed results

in fact the network hopes to set up offices in warsaw and <unk> else in the east bloc that will have it
but the rapid changes brought on by <unk> and open <unk> are <unk> the network 's life in more ways than one
in fact radio free europe is in danger of suffering from its success
while the network currently can operate <unk> in <unk> so can others
in addition competition for <unk> is getting tougher in many ways than when broadcasting here was <unk> controlled
instead of being <unk> as an <unk> agent of <unk> radio free europe is more likely to draw the criticism that its programs are too <unk> even <unk>
they have a lot to do these days to compete with <unk> radio says <unk> <unk> a <unk> student at the technical university in <unk>
the <unk> radio reporters seem better informed and more critical about about what 's going on here
indeed hungary is in the <unk> of a media <unk>

months before the decision by the <unk> communist party to <unk> itself socialist and try to look more <unk> to voters the country 's <unk> were trying to look more <unk>
it proved a perfect time for radio free europe to ask for permission to set up office
not only did the <unk> ministry of foreign affairs approve radio free europe 's new location but the ministry of telecommunications did something even more <unk> they found us four phone lines in central <unk> says <unk> <unk> a radio free europe <unk> who helped <unk> the <unk> location
that is a <unk>
it 's a far <unk> from the previous treatment of the network which had to <unk> <unk> of its <unk> and <unk> of local <unk> who filed reports to the network by phone secret <unk> or letters
in fact some of the network 's <unk> <unk> say they <unk> radio free europe loyalty because it was responsible in many ways for keeping hope alive through what one writer here calls the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> century
during the past four years many of us have sat up until late at night <unk> to our <unk> says the writer

television which most of the time is considered rather <unk> has entered the running with a new program the end of the day which comes on after N <unk>
it is a talk show with opposition leaders and political experts who discuss hungary 's domestic problems as well as foreign affairs
those who want to hear even more radical views have to get up at five on sunday morning for sunday journal on <unk> radio
the competitive <unk> is clearly <unk> radio free europe which is trying to beef up programs
the <unk> office plans to hire <unk> reporters to cover the latest <unk> in <unk> country <unk> from <unk> in the west to <unk> in the east
the <unk> service has a daily <unk> news show called <unk> with international and domestic news plus a daily news review of <unk> from around the world
there 's also a host of new programs trying to <unk> up on the traditional diet of politics

proposals for <unk> national service like <unk> <unk> up from time to time <unk> the resistance of the body <unk> run their course and seem to <unk> only to <unk> and <unk> public life <unk>
the <unk> <unk> comes to mind of course not as an <unk> on the <unk> of national service
rather it is born of <unk> with having to <unk> <unk> changing <unk> of a <unk> idea that one thought had been eliminated in the early 1970s along with <unk>
it is back with us again in the form of legislation to pay <unk> under a national and community service act a proposal with a serious shot at congressional <unk> this fall
why does the <unk> virus keep coming back
perhaps it is because <unk> <unk> <unk> both military experience and the social <unk>
if only we could get america 's <unk> <unk> into at least a <unk> <unk> we might be able to <unk> <unk> again and revive the <unk> of giving
a quarter of a century ago national service was <unk> as a way of <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> by of all things expanding the <unk>
those of us who <unk> the idea then suspect today that an obligation of government service for all young people is still the true long-term aim of many <unk> <unk> despite their <unk> that present plans contain no <unk>
choice of the <unk> military in the 1970s seemed to <unk> national service as much as the <unk>
but the virus was kept alive in <unk> departments until a couple of years ago when it again was let loose
this time it attempted to <unk> two connected problems the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal government of educational grants and loans
why not keep and even expand the loans and grants the <unk> <unk> but require some form of service from each <unk>
military service moreover could be a <unk> option
thus <unk> it was hoped that the new strain of national service would prove <unk> <unk> <unk> conservatives <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
the democratic leadership council a <unk> group <unk> the plan <unk> thought it might help the party to attract support especially among college students and their parents
a provision allowing grants to be applied to <unk> purchases was added to appeal to those who had had enough of <unk>
the <unk> plan <unk> <unk> <unk> trees <unk> <unk> <unk> children and <unk> <unk> for $ N a week tax free plus medical care
with a <unk> $ N <unk> payment at the end of each year the <unk> would be making a wage comparable to $ N a year
mind you most of the <unk> would be <unk> N to <unk> some not even high school <unk> and many <unk> money by living at home
they would be doing better financially under national service than many taxpayers working at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting families
as it happened political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that <unk> on the present education grant system so the <unk> <unk> decided to <unk> the <unk> crucial principle of give in order to get
opposition to national service from the pentagon which wants to protect its own <unk> process also led to the <unk> option being dropped
clearly a new <unk> for national service had to be <unk> up
what better place to turn than sen. edward kennedy 's labor committee that great <unk> of government <unk> where many a <unk> <unk> of <unk> is kept on the back <unk> until it can be brought forward and presented as <unk> <unk>
before the <unk> is <unk> the house may add more <unk> also changing the initial price now posted at some $ N million
it is widely known that too many <unk> <unk> the <unk> but that <unk> does not necessarily reflect the view of the <unk> especially if they are senators
the <unk> bill coming out of congress may be <unk> <unk> but the <unk> <unk> are happy and the restaurant is pushing the <unk> very hard
the <unk> of <unk> is in the air
is the <unk> sector so weak that it needs such <unk> assistance
on the <unk> it is as robust as ever
according to the <unk> poll american <unk> <unk> an average of two hours a week of service while financial contributions to charity in the 1980s have risen N N adjusted for inflation
even if government does see various <unk> needs national service is not the way to meet them
if we want to support students we might <unk> the idea used in other countries of offering more <unk> based on something called <unk> rather than on the government 's idea of service
or we might provide a tax credit for working students
what we do not need to do is start a war and then try to <unk> it by creating a <unk> bill
to the extent we lack <unk> to staff <unk> jobs in hospitals for example we should raise pay pursue <unk> technology or allow more legal <unk> rather than <unk> high school <unk> as short-term workers and cause <unk> among permanent workers paid <unk> amounts to do the same jobs
will national service in the current highly <unk> and <unk> form <unk> enough appeal to get adopted
not necessarily
polls show wide <unk> support for some <unk> concept of service but the bill now under <unk> <unk> any <unk> public backing
<unk> senate democrats are <unk> a roll of supporting <unk> <unk> and <unk> some of which may hope to receive the paid <unk>
so far the president seems <unk> to <unk> any of the <unk> for his own <unk> proposal to <unk> a points of light foundation with $ N million to <unk> citizens of all <unk> and <unk> them to <unk> <unk>
however even this <unk> plan could become <unk> if the white house gives in to congressional democratic pressure to add to the <unk> of the president 's initiative or to involve the independent foundation in <unk> federal funds for <unk> projects
there 's no need for such concessions
the <unk> can be <unk> the virus controlled and real service protected
national service the <unk> idea still wo n't go away then of course but the millions of <unk> <unk> <unk> works of <unk> <unk> will be <unk> only in the <unk> of their <unk>
mr. <unk> is a fellow at the <unk> <unk> institute

the debate over national service has begun again
after a decade in which more than N <unk> established their own service or <unk> <unk> and <unk> of school systems made community service a <unk> to <unk> <unk> the focus has <unk> to washington
at least N bills <unk> one or another national program were introduced in congress this spring
one <unk> by sen. sam <unk> d. <unk> and rep. <unk> <unk> d. <unk> would have restricted federal college subsidies to students who had served
an <unk> bill <unk> by sen. edward kennedy d. mass. and including some diluted <unk> provisions along with proposals by fellow democratic <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and christopher <unk> has been reported out of the senate labor committee
it might well win senate <unk>
president bush has <unk> his own <unk> <unk> service yes plan though its details remain to be specified
what is one to think of all this
<unk> and special interests <unk> some <unk>
people eager to have <unk> pay their <unk> to society favor service proposals <unk> <unk> ones
so do those who seek a <unk> concept of <unk> a concept <unk> <unk> <unk> as well as <unk> rights
then there are <unk> opponents
to <unk> <unk> service is an <unk> and <unk> systems are <unk> uses of tax money
<unk> of the market question the value of the work national service would <unk>
if the market wo n't pay for it they argue it ca n't be worth its cost
<unk> of the left are also <unk> opposed they see service as a cover for the <unk> or fear the <unk> of <unk> or want to see rights <unk> not <unk>
but what about those of us whose views are not <unk> by formula or <unk>
how should we think about national service
let 's begin by <unk> a main source of <unk> national service has no agreed meaning
would service be <unk> or <unk>
short or long
<unk> or <unk>
paid or <unk>
would participants live at home and work nearby or live in <unk> and work on public <unk>
what kinds of work would they do
what does national mean
would the program be run by the federal government by local governments or by private <unk> organizations
and who would serve
only <unk> as with the <unk> or both <unk>
<unk> only or all <unk>
<unk> people or poor people or a <unk> <unk>
many or few
those are not <unk> questions and the <unk> national service <unk> none of them
then how should we think about national service
as a starting point here are five <unk> N consider the <unk> not the name
<unk> national service in the <unk> consider specific proposals
they will <unk> in crucial ways
N service should be service
as <unk> understood service <unk> <unk>
it <unk> <unk> risk or giving up income or <unk> a career
it follows that proposals like <unk> whose benefits to <unk> are worth some $ N a year do not qualify
there is a <unk> for such bills federal subsidies to college students amount to a <unk> bill without the <unk> <unk> those benefits should be earned not given
but the earnings exceed by N N the average income of young <unk> <unk> with <unk> jobs
why call that service
N <unk> is fine <unk> is not
<unk> service is <unk>
it is also <unk> and <unk>
who will throw several hundred thousand <unk> in jail each year
but through tax policy and in other ways the federal government <unk> many kinds of behavior
it should also encourage service <unk> by all classes and all <unk>
its <unk> should <unk> and not <unk> the strong <unk> of <unk> in the u.s. should build on the service programs already in <unk> and should <unk> local <unk> about which <unk> most need doing
N good programs are not cheap
<unk> assume that national service would get important work done <unk> forest <unk> <unk> housing <unk> students <unk> <unk> centers <unk>
there is important work to be done and existing service and <unk> <unk> have shown that even <unk> who start with few <unk> can do much of it well but not <unk>
good service programs require <unk> <unk> training and <unk> all of high quality
they involve <unk> to participants
<unk> residential programs also require housing and <unk> <unk> they are particularly expensive more per <unk> than a year at <unk> or <unk>
<unk> programs are cheaper but good ones still come to some $ N a year
are they worth that
<unk> suggest that good ones are especially so if the effects on participants are <unk>
but the calculations are <unk>
N <unk> <unk> are a special concern
are such expenditures <unk> then
yes if <unk>
people of all <unk> and all classes should be encouraged to serve but there are many ways for <unk> kids and their <unk> to serve at little public cost
they can <unk> at any of thousands of <unk> institutions or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by <unk> or employers
<unk> <unk> do n't have those opportunities
they are not <unk> in high school or college
they are unlikely to be <unk>
and they have grown up in <unk> <unk> circumstances among family structures breaking down <unk> by <unk> <unk> and <unk> prospects
but many of them can be quite <unk> <unk> by <unk> and <unk> service
some wo n't accept the discipline others drop out for other reasons
but some whom nothing else is <unk> are <unk>
learning <unk> producing something <unk> feeling <unk> they are no longer <unk> others now <unk> on them
even if it is cheaper to build <unk> or <unk> <unk> or plant <unk> with paid professionals the effects on the young people providing those services alter the <unk>
<unk> <unk> these <unk> are not <unk> service
they are giving up no income <unk> no <unk> <unk> no risk
but they believe themselves to be serving and they begin to <unk> themselves and others to take control of their lives to think of the future
that is a service to the nation
it is what federal support should try <unk> to <unk>

though the offering did n't sell out james j. <unk> chairman and chief executive officer said we 're pretty <unk> of the employees ' response
he noted that unlike an employee stock ownership plan where a company usually <unk> money from third party lenders to buy stock that it sets aside to award employees over time here employees had to <unk> out their own cash for the stock
they came up with their own money instead of borrowed money mr. <unk> said
it 's totally different

we 're in a service business and in that <unk> it 's <unk> to have your employees involved in the ownership so they have a stake in the success
the brokerage firm wo n't pay a dividend on the stock

when you get panic in one market you get flight to quality in the other said <unk> <unk> money market economist at drexel burnham lambert inc

any sustained <unk> could be a <unk> for junk bonds as well as other securities
robert dow a partner and portfolio manager at <unk> <unk> & co. which manages $ N billion of high-yield bonds says he does n't think there is any fundamental economic <unk> for the junk bond <unk>
it was <unk> <unk>
he adds the junk market has <unk> some trouble and now some people think that if the equity market gets <unk> that means the economy will be <unk> and that 's bad for junk
i do n't believe that 's the case but i believe that people are running <unk>
there is a flight to quality and the quality is not in equities and not in junk it 's in treasurys
even as trading in high-yield issues <unk> up over the past month corporations sold more than $ N billion of new junk bonds
for example a recent $ N million offering of <unk> gas services <unk> bonds sold by first boston was three times <unk>
a $ N million offering of turner broadcasting system inc high-yield securities sold last week by drexel was increased $ N million because of strong demand

when the rally comes insurance companies will be leading it because they have billions to invest and invest they will
there is plenty of money available from people who want to buy <unk> deals it 's the stuff that 's financed on a <unk> that people are wary of
but such highly leveraged transactions seemed to have <unk> this year <unk> a <unk> over much of the junk market
michael <unk> director of fixed-income research at <unk> financial services says the quality of junk issues has been getting <unk> <unk> to the slide in prices
last year we probably bought one out of every three new deals he says
this year at best it 's in one in every five or six
and our credit standards have n't changed one <unk>
however mr. <unk> said the slide in junk is creating one <unk> of a buying opportunity for <unk> buyers
for the moment investors seem more <unk> with the bad junk than the good junk
the market has been weak since the announcement of the campeau cash squeeze and the company 's subsequent bailout by <unk> & york says mr. <unk> of merrill lynch
that really affected the market in that people started to ask what else is in trouble
well before campeau though there were signs that the junk market was <unk> through one of its worst years ever
despite the relatively strong economy junk bond prices did nothing except go down <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> of bad news

friday 's <unk> plunge in stocks does not come <unk> the climate of anxiety that dominated financial markets just prior to their N october crash and <unk> have been put in place to keep markets more <unk>
still the <unk> is about the same on friday the <unk> the market was <unk> by washington
the consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the ual takeover and it 's certainly true the <unk> began immediately after the ual trading halt
still the consensus seems almost as wide that one <unk> bid is no reason to write down the value of all u.s. business
this <unk> leads us to another piece of news moving on the dow jones <unk> shortly before the downturn the success of senate democrats in <unk> the capital gains tax cut
the real value of all shares after all is directly <unk> by the tax on any profits all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not <unk> income
and market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the house last month
an hour before friday 's plunge that provision was <unk> from the tax bill leaving it with $ N billion in tax increases without a capital gains cut
there is a great deal to be said to be sure for <unk> the <unk> out of the <unk> bill
it would be a good thing if congress started to decide issues <unk> on their individual <unk> without <unk>
for one thing no one <unk> that the capital gains cut would pass on an <unk> vote
since senate leaders have so far <unk> it up with <unk> <unk> promises of a <unk> bill are suspect
especially so since president bush has been weakened by the panama <unk>
to the extent that the ual troubles contributed to the plunge they are another instance of washington 's <unk> <unk>
as the best opportunities for corporate <unk> are <unk> of course at some point the market will start to <unk> them
but the airlines are <unk> a clear case given <unk> <unk> by secretary of transportation <unk> who <unk> to believe safety will be <unk> if <unk> and british airways own interests in companies that fly <unk>
worse congress has started to jump on the <unk> <unk>
james <unk> the minnesota democrat who <unk> the public works and transportation committee 's aviation subcommittee has put an <unk> takeover bill on <unk> speed so that it would be passed in time to affect the american and united air lines bids
it would give mr. <unk> up to N days to review any bid for N N or more of the voting stock of any u.s. carrier with revenues of $ N billion or more
so the ual deal has problems and the market <unk> N points
<unk> mr. secretary and mr. congressman
in the N crash remember the market was <unk> by a <unk> <unk> proposal to tax takeovers out of <unk>
even more important in our view was the treasury 's threat to <unk> the dollar
the treasury is doing the same thing today <unk> the dollar is not under <unk> pressure
also traders are in better shape today than in N to <unk> selling <unk>
they are better <unk>
they are in less danger of losing liquidity simply because of tape <unk> and clearing and settlement delays
the fed promises any needed liquidity
the big board 's <unk> with the chicago board of trade has improved it will be interesting to learn if circuit <unk> prove to be a good idea
in any event some traders see stocks as <unk> today unlike N
there is nothing wrong with the market that ca n't be <unk> by a little <unk> and common sense in washington
but on the bearish side that may be too much to expect
first chicago corp. posted a third-quarter loss of $ N million after joining other big banks in further adding to its reserves for losses on foreign loans
the parent company of first national bank of chicago with $ N billion in assets said it set aside $ N million to absorb losses on loans and investments in financially troubled countries
the addition on top of two big N <unk> to <unk> reserves <unk> the reserve to a level <unk> N N of <unk> and long-term loans outstanding to troubled nations
first chicago since N has reduced its loans to such nations to $ N billion from $ N billion
despite this loss first chicago said it does n't need to sell stock to raise capital
during the quarter the company realized a pretax gain of $ N million from the sale of its first chicago investment <unk> unit
combined foreign exchange and bond trading profits <unk> N N against last year 's third quarter to $ N million from $ N million
gains from first chicago 's venture capital unit a big leveraged buy-out investor rose N N to $ N million from $ N million a year ago

for those hoping to see a <unk> of political <unk> restored in view of <unk> 's <unk> <unk> under <unk> <unk> and subsequent three-month <unk> with a <unk> coalition government there is but one bright sign the <unk> still <unk> former prime minister <unk> <unk> and his fallen socialist government are like <unk> <unk> around a <unk> <unk>
in the <unk> round of voting <unk> gave no clear <unk> to any single political party
the ad <unk> coalition government that emerged from <unk> <unk> was in <unk> little more than the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> on one side the <unk> new democracy party headed by <unk> <unk>
on the other the so-called coalition of the left and progress a <unk> and rather <unk> title for a merger of the <unk> communist party of <unk> and its <unk> <unk> the <unk> left
the <unk> bond for this <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> mr. <unk> 's party as common political <unk>
the <unk> goal was a <unk> of government <unk> <unk> at all levels but the main marks were mr. <unk> and his <unk> associates
in point of fact this <unk> was <unk> by decades
when reduced to <unk> status in <unk> <unk> <unk> however the notion <unk> into a promised <unk> with targets primarily for political gains not justice
with <unk> to <unk> 's <unk> <unk> scandal mr. <unk> 's principal <unk> remains george <unk> former owner of the bank of <unk> and <unk> <unk> now <unk> in a jail <unk> in <unk> mass. from where he is fighting <unk> proceedings that would return him to <unk>
mr. <unk> 's credibility is at best <unk>
he has <unk> <unk> to shift the blame and his <unk> has also been found less than <unk> on numerous points
nevertheless the new democracy and communist parties <unk> his <unk> as <unk> of <unk> <unk>
among <unk> questions are whether mr. <unk> received $ N million of <unk> bank of <unk> funds and an additional $ N in <unk> as <unk> whether the prime minister ordered state agencies to deposit some $ N million in mr. <unk> 's bank and then <unk> off the interest and what <unk> 's cut was from the $ N million mr. <unk> <unk>
two former ministers were so heavily <unk> in the <unk> affair that <unk> members of parliament voted to <unk> them to the special court
but <unk> <unk> probe was the case of millions of <unk> mr. <unk> <unk> into new democracy <unk>
in the end the investigation produced only <unk> evidence and indications that point to <unk> not <unk> <unk>
on another issue <unk> were told how their national intelligence agency the <unk> <unk> <unk> the telephone <unk> of <unk> figures including key opposition politicians <unk> and <unk> <unk> members
despite <unk> <unk> it was never established that mr. <unk> <unk> ordered or <unk> the <unk>
the central weakness of the <unk> <unk> was pointed up especially well when discussions <unk> on arms deals and <unk>
the coalition government tried to show that <unk> ministers had received hefty <unk> for <unk> the purchase of <unk> fighting <unk> and <unk> N <unk> aircraft produced by the <unk> general dynamics corp. and france 's <unk> <unk> <unk> respectively
naturally neither general dynamics nor <unk> could be expected to <unk> its <unk> future dealings by making <unk> of <unk> paid or not to various <unk> officials for services <unk>
so it seems that mr. <unk> and his communist <unk> may have <unk> served mr. <unk> a <unk> victory on a <unk> <unk> whether guilty or not can now <unk> the <unk> <unk> the whole affair as a <unk> hunt at mr. <unk> 's expense
but while <unk> high <unk> alone wo n't help <unk> <unk> power mr. <unk> should never be <unk>
first came his <unk> <unk> he charged the coalition of the left and progress had sold out its <unk> <unk> by <unk> in a <unk> <unk> aimed at <unk> <unk> and <unk> the course of socialism in <unk>
then to <unk> his credibility with the left he <unk> some smaller <unk> parties to stand for election under the <unk> <unk>
next he continued to court the communists many of whom feel <unk> by the <unk> coalition 's <unk> by bringing into <unk> a <unk> communist party candidate
for balance and in hopes of <unk> some <unk> <unk> votes he managed to attract a former new democracy party representative and known political <unk> of mr. <unk>
thus <unk> heads for the polls not only with <unk> <unk> but also with <unk> of approval from representatives of its <unk> <unk>
crucial as these elections are for <unk> <unk> issues of state are getting lost in the <unk>
the country 's future <unk> participation remains <unk> for instance
<unk> also must <unk> major pieces of legislation in <unk> for the N targets of <unk> common market cooperation
<unk> 's <unk> relations with the u.s. need attention soon as well
for one the current accord concerning u.s. military <unk> in <unk> <unk> in may N
negotiations for a new agreement were <unk> before the june elections but the <unk> is running
another matter of concern is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> who is wanted in the u.s. for the N <unk> of a pan american airways flight
the <unk> courts have decided in favor of <unk> in the <unk> case but the matter <unk> final approval from <unk> 's next justice minister
the <unk> seem barely aware of the importance of the case as a <unk> test of whether <unk> will be <unk> in or out for international efforts to <unk> terrorism
that <unk> could win the elections <unk> is <unk> the <unk> press previously eager to <unk> off <unk> 's line has turned on mr. <unk> with a <unk> <unk>
yet the possibility of another <unk> government is all too real
if mr. <unk> becomes the major opposition leader he could <unk> a <unk> coalition
also he could force new elections early next year by <unk> the procedures for the election of the president of the republic in march
new democracy has once again <unk> <unk> the <unk> and linked its own prospects to negative reaction against <unk> <unk> to tend to either program <unk> or the <unk> of internal <unk>
as for mr. <unk>
he 's not exactly sitting pretty at this stage

<unk> <unk> in los angeles contributed to this <unk>
of all the one-time expenses <unk> by a corporation or professional firm few are larger or longer term than the purchase of real estate or the <unk> of a commercial lease
to take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment however the corporation or professional firm must do more than <unk> the best purchase price or lease terms
it must also <unk> the real-estate market in the chosen location from a new perspective
specifically it must understand how real-estate markets <unk> to <unk> in regional <unk> and then take advantage of these opportunities
when a regional economy <unk> cold the local real-estate market gets <unk>
in other words real-estate market <unk> such as building <unk> and leasing activity <unk> much further than a local economy in recession
this was seen in the late <unk> in los angeles and the <unk> in new york
but the reverse is also true when a region 's economy <unk> from a slowdown these real-estate <unk> will rebound far faster than the <unk> economy
why do local real-estate markets <unk> to regional economic <unk>
because real-estate purchases and <unk> are such major long-term commitments that most companies and individuals make these decisions only when confident of future economic <unk> and growth
metropolitan <unk> was written off <unk> during the early 1980s as the domestic auto industry suffered a serious sales <unk> and adjustment
area employment dropped by N N from its N peak and retail sales were down N N
however the real-estate market was hurt even more
for example residential building <unk> in the <unk> year of N were off N N from the N peak level
once metropolitan <unk> 's economy rallied in the <unk> real estate rebounded
building <unk> for example soared a <unk> N N between N and the peak year of N
where <unk> corporations and professional firms are now asking are today 's opportunities
look no further than metropolitan houston and denver two of the most depressed <unk> and potentially <unk> real-estate markets in the nation
of course some observers have <unk> houston and denver for the past five years as a <unk> play
but now appears to be the time to act
metropolitan houston 's economy did drop and then <unk> in the years after its N peak
in the <unk> employment was down as much as N N from the N peak and retail sales were off N N
the real-estate market suffered even more severe <unk>
office construction dropped N N
the <unk> rate soared more than N N in nearly every product category and more than N N of office space was <unk>
to some observers the <unk> office buildings of houston 's <unk> <unk> were <unk> of a very troubled economy
as usual the real-estate market had <unk>
actually the region 's economy retained a firm foundation
metropolitan houston 's population has held steady over the past six years
and personal income after <unk> in the <unk> has returned to its N level in real dollar terms
today metropolitan houston 's real-estate market is <unk> for a significant turnaround
more than N jobs were added in <unk> houston last year primarily in <unk> <unk> processing and the computer industry
this growth puts houston in the top five <unk> areas in the nation last year
and forecasts project a N N to N N growth rate in jobs over the next few years nearly twice the national average
denver is another metropolitan area where the commercial real-estate market has <unk> to the region 's economic trends although denver has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as houston
by some measures metropolitan denver 's economy has actually improved in the past four years
its population has continued to increase since N the peak year of the economic cycle
employment is now N N higher than in N
buying income in real dollars actually increased N N between N and N the most recent year available
the rates of increase however are less than the rapid growth of the <unk> years and this has resulted in a loss of confidence in the economy
in a <unk> <unk> therefore the region 's real-estate market all but collapsed in recent years
housing building <unk> are down more than N N from their N <unk>
although no one can predict when metropolitan denver 's real-estate market will rebound major public works projects <unk> several billion dollars are under way or planned such as a new <unk> center a major <unk> <unk> the metropolitan area and a new regional airport
when denver 's regional economy begins to grow faster such a recovery could <unk> as early as next year business and consumer confidence will return and the resulting <unk> of real-estate activity will <unk> the general economic rebound
what real-estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan area whose economic health is not as easy to determine as houston 's or denver 's
generally <unk> in commercial real estate is dropping from its <unk> peak even in such <unk> healthy metropolitan areas as washington new york and los angeles
<unk> rates in the N N to N N range today may easily rise to the low to <unk> N range in a couple of years
under these conditions even a <unk> out of economic growth <unk> cold in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for <unk> as the <unk> industry <unk> <unk>
those looking for real-estate <unk> in <unk> metropolitan areas should <unk> in <unk> or buy now those looking in healthy metropolitan areas should take a short-term <unk> lease and wait for the <unk> ahead
